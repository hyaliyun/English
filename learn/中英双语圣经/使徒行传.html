<p>徒1:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach</p>
<p>提阿非罗啊，我已经作了前书，论到耶稣开头一切所行所教训的，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</p>
<p>直到他藉着圣灵吩咐所拣选的使徒，以后被接上升的日子为止。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>他受害之后，用许多的凭据将自己活活地显给使徒看，四十天之久向他们显现，讲说　神国的事。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: &quot;Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.</p>
<p>耶稣和他们聚集的时候，嘱咐他们说：“不要离开耶路撒冷，要等候父所应许的，就是你们听见我说过的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>约翰是用水施洗，但不多几日，你们要受圣灵的洗。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when they met together, they asked him, &quot;Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?&quot;</p>
<p>他们聚集的时候，问耶稣说：“主啊，你复兴以色列国就在这时候吗？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He said to them: &quot;It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.</p>
<p>耶稣对他们说：“父凭着自己的权柄所定的时候、日期，不是你们可以知道的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&quot;</p>
<p>但圣灵降临在你们身上，你们就必得着能力；并要在耶路撒冷、犹太全地和撒马利亚，直到地极，作我的见证。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</p>
<p>说了这话，他们正看的时候，他就被取上升，有一朵云彩把他接去，便看不见他了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.</p>
<p>当他往上去，他们定睛望天的时候，忽然有两个人身穿白衣，站在旁边，说：</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Men of Galilee,&quot; they said, &quot;why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>“加利利人哪，你们为什么站着望天呢？这离开你们被接升天的耶稣，你们见他怎样往天上去，他还要怎样来。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day&#x27;s walk from the city.</p>
<p>有一座山，名叫橄榄山，离耶路撒冷不远，约有安息日可走的路程。当下，门徒从那里回耶路撒冷去，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</p>
<p>进了城，就上了所住的一间楼房。在那里有彼得、约翰、雅各、安得烈、腓力、多马、巴多罗买、马太、亚勒腓的儿子雅各、奋锐党的西门和雅各的儿子（或作“兄弟”）犹大。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:14</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</p>
<p>这些人同着几个妇人和耶稣的母亲马利亚，并耶稣的弟兄，都同心合意地恒切祷告。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:15</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)</p>
<p>那时，有许多人聚会，约有一百二十名，彼得就在弟兄中间站起来，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:16</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and said, &quot;Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus--</p>
<p>说：“弟兄们，圣灵藉大卫的口，在圣经上预言领人捉拿耶稣的犹大，这话是必须应验的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.&quot;</p>
<p>他本来列在我们数中，并且在使徒的职任上得了一分。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:18</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</p>
<p>这人用他作恶的工价买了一块田，以后身子仆倒，肚腹崩裂，肠子都流出来。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:19</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</p>
<p>住在耶路撒冷的众人都知道这事，所以按着他们那里的话给那块田起名叫亚革大马，就是血田的意思。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:20</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For,&quot; said Peter, &quot;it is written in the book of Psalms, &quot;&#x27;May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,&#x27; and, &quot;&#x27;May another take his place of leadership.&#x27;</p>
<p>因为诗篇上写着说：‘愿他的住处变为荒场，无人在内居住，’又说：‘愿别人得他的职分。’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:21</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</p>
<p>所以主耶稣在我们中间始终出入的时候，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:22</p>
<blockquote>
<p>beginning from John&#x27;s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.&quot;</p>
<p>就是从约翰施洗起，直到主离开我们被接上升的日子为止，必须从那常与我们作伴的人中，立一位与我们同作耶稣复活的见证。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:23</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.</p>
<p>于是选举两个人，就是那叫作巴撒巴，又称呼犹士都的约瑟和马提亚。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:24</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they prayed, &quot;Lord, you know everyone&#x27;s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen</p>
<p>众人就祷告说，主啊，你知道万人的心，求你从这两个人中，指明你所拣选的是谁，叫他得这使徒的位分。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.&quot;</p>
<p>这位分犹大已经丢弃，往自己的地方去了。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒1:26</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.</p>
<p>于是众人为他们摇签，摇出马提亚来；他就和十一个使徒同列。</p>

<p>徒2:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.</p>
<p>五旬节到了，门徒都聚集在一处。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.</p>
<p>忽然，从天上有响声下来，好像一阵大风吹过，充满了他们所坐的屋子；</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.</p>
<p>又有舌头如火焰显现出来，分开落在他们各人头上。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.</p>
<p>他们就都被圣灵充满，按着圣灵所赐的口才，说起别国的话来。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.</p>
<p>那时，有虔诚的犹太人从天下各国来，住在耶路撒冷。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</p>
<p>这声音一响，众人都来聚集。各人听见门徒用众人的乡谈说话，就甚纳闷，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Utterly amazed, they asked: &quot;Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?</p>
<p>都惊讶希奇说：“看哪，这说话的不都是加利利人吗？</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language?</p>
<p>我们各人怎么听见他们说我们生来所用的乡谈呢？</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</p>
<p>我们帕提亚人、玛代人、以拦人，和住在米所波大米、犹太、加帕多家、本都、亚西亚、</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome</p>
<p>弗吕家、旁非利亚、埃及的人，并靠近古利奈的利比亚一带地方的人，从罗马来的客旅中，或是犹太人，或是进犹太教的人，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>徒2:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!&quot;</p>
<p>革哩底和亚拉伯人，都听见他们用我们的乡谈，讲说　神的大作为。”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>徒27:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.</p>
<p>既然把小船拉上来，就用缆索捆绑船底，又恐怕在赛耳底沙滩上搁了浅，就落下篷来，任船飘去。</p>

<p>徒27:33</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. &quot;For the last fourteen days,&quot; he said, &quot;you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven&#x27;t eaten anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.</p>
