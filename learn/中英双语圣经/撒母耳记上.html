<p>撒上1:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</p>
<p>以法莲山地的拉玛琐非有一个以法莲人，名叫以利加拿，是苏弗的玄孙、托户的曾孙、以利户的孙子、耶罗罕的儿子。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</p>
<p>他有两个妻：一名哈拿，一名毗尼拿。毗尼拿有儿女，哈拿没有儿女。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</p>
<p>这人每年从本城上到示罗，敬拜祭祀万军之耶和华。在那里有以利的两个儿子何弗尼、非尼哈当耶和华的祭司。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</p>
<p>以利加拿每逢献祭的日子，将祭肉分给他的妻毗尼拿和毗尼拿所生的儿女。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</p>
<p>给哈拿的却是双份，因为他爱哈拿。无奈耶和华不使哈拿生育。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</p>
<p>毗尼拿见耶和华不使哈拿生育，就作她的对头，大大激动她，要使她生气。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</p>
<p>每年上到耶和华殿的时候，以利加拿都以双份给哈拿。毗尼拿仍是激动她，以致她哭泣不吃饭。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elkanah her husband would say to her, &quot;Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don&#x27;t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don&#x27;t I mean more to you than ten sons?&quot;</p>
<p>她丈夫以利加拿对她说：“哈拿啊，你为何哭泣不吃饭，心里愁闷呢？有我不比十个儿子还好吗？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD&#x27;S temple.</p>
<p>他们在示罗吃喝完了，哈拿就站起来。祭司以利在耶和华殿的门框旁边，坐在自己的位上。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</p>
<p>哈拿心里愁苦，就痛痛哭泣，祈祷耶和华，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And she made a vow, saying, &quot;O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant&#x27;s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.&quot;</p>
<p>许愿说：“万军之耶和华啊，你若垂顾婢女的苦情，眷念不忘婢女，赐我一个儿子，我必使他终身归与耶和华，不用剃头刀剃他的头。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</p>
<p>哈拿在耶和华面前不住地祈祷，以利定睛看她的嘴。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</p>
<p>原来哈拿心中默祷，只动嘴唇，不出声音，因此以利以为她喝醉了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:14</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and said to her, &quot;How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.&quot;</p>
<p>以利对她说：“你要醉到几时呢？你不应该喝酒。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:15</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not so, my lord,&quot; Hannah replied, &quot;I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</p>
<p>哈拿回答说：“主啊，不是这样，我是心里愁苦的妇人，清酒浓酒都没有喝，但在耶和华面前倾心吐意。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:16</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.&quot;</p>
<p>不要将婢女看作不正经的女子。我因被人激动，愁苦太多，所以祈求到如今。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eli answered, &quot;Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.&quot;</p>
<p>以利说：“你可以平平安安地回去，愿以色列的　神允准你向他所求的！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:18</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She said, &quot;May your servant find favor in your eyes.&quot; Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</p>
<p>哈拿说：“愿婢女在你眼前蒙恩。”于是妇人走去吃饭，面上再不带愁容了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:19</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</p>
<p>次日清早，他们起来，在耶和华面前敬拜，就回拉玛。到了家里，以利加拿和妻哈拿同房，耶和华顾念哈拿，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:20</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, &quot;Because I asked the LORD for him.&quot;</p>
<p>哈拿就怀孕。日期满足，生了一个儿子，给他起名叫撒母耳，说：“这是我从耶和华那里求来的。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:21</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</p>
<p>以利加拿和他全家都上示罗去，要向耶和华献年祭，并还所许的愿。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:22</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, &quot;After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always.&quot;</p>
<p>哈拿却没有上去，对丈夫说：“等孩子断了奶，我便带他上去朝见耶和华，使他永远住在那里。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:23</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do what seems best to you,&quot; Elkanah her husband told her. &quot;Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word.&quot; So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</p>
<p>她丈夫以利加拿说：“就随你的意行吧！可以等儿子断了奶，但愿耶和华应验他的话。”于是妇人在家里乳养儿子，直到断了奶。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:24</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</p>
<p>既断了奶，就把孩子带上示罗，到了耶和华的殿，又带了三只公牛，一伊法细面，一皮袋酒。（那时孩子还小。）</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</p>
<p>宰了一只公牛，就领孩子到以利面前。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:26</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and she said to him, &quot;As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</p>
<p>妇人说：“主啊，我敢  在你面前起誓，从前在你这里站着祈求耶和华的那妇人，就是我。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:27</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</p>
<p>我祈求为要得这孩子，耶和华已将我所求的赐给我了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上1:28</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD.&quot; And he worshiped the LORD there.</p>
<p>所以我将这孩子归与耶和华，使他终身归与耶和华。”于是在那里敬拜耶和华。</p>

<p>撒上2:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Hannah prayed and said: &quot;My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.</p>
<p>哈拿祷告说：“我的心因耶和华快乐，我的角因耶和华高举。我的口向仇敌张开，我因耶和华的救恩欢欣。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上2:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.</p>
<p>只有耶和华为圣，除他以外没有可比的，也没有磐石像我们的　神。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上2:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.</p>
<p>人不要夸口说骄傲的话，也不要出狂妄的言语，因耶和华是大有知识的　神，人的行为被他衡量。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上2:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.</p>
<p>勇士的弓都已折断，跌倒的人以力量束腰。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上2:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.</p>
<p>素来饱足的，反作佣人求食；饥饿的，再不饥饿。不生育的，生了七个儿子；多有儿女的，反倒衰微。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上2:6</p>

<p>Saul replied, &quot;Say to David, &#x27;The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.&#x27;&quot; Saul&#x27;s plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.</p>
<p>扫罗说：“你们要对大卫这样说：‘王不要什么聘礼，只要一百非利士人的阳皮，好在王的仇敌身上报仇。’”扫罗的意思要使大卫丧在非利士人的手里。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king&#x27;s son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,</p>

<p>David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king&#x27;s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.</p>
<p>大卫和跟随他的人起身前往，杀了二百非利士人，将阳皮满数交给王，为要作王的女婿。于是，扫罗将女儿米甲给大卫为妻。</p>

<p>But the priest answered David, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here--provided the men have kept themselves from women.&quot;</p>
<p>祭司对大卫说：“我手下没有寻常的饼，只有圣饼，若少年人没有亲近妇人才可以给。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上21:5</p>

<p>David replied, &quot;Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever I set out. The men&#x27;s things are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!&quot;</p>
<p>大卫对祭司说：“实在约有三日我们没有亲近妇人。我出来的时候，虽是寻常行路，少年人的器皿还是洁净的；何况今日不更是洁净吗？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上21:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.</p>
<p>祭司就拿圣饼给他，因为在那里没有别样饼，只有更换新饼，从耶和华面前撤下来的陈设饼。</p>

<p>撒上21:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David asked Ahimelech, &quot;Don&#x27;t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven&#x27;t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king&#x27;s business was urgent.&quot;</p>
<p>大卫问亚希米勒说：“你手下有枪有刀没有？因为王的事甚急，连刀剑器械我都没有带。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上21:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The priest replied, &quot;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.&quot; David said, &quot;There is none like it; give it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>祭司说：“你在以拉谷杀非利士人歌利亚的那刀在这里，  裹在布中，放在以弗得后边，你要就可以拿去。除此以外，再没有别的。”大卫说：“这刀没有可比的！求你给我。”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the servants of Achish said to him, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this David, the king of the land? Isn&#x27;t he the one they sing about in their dances: &quot;&#x27;Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>亚吉的臣仆对亚吉说：“这不是以色列国王大卫吗？那里的妇女跳舞唱和，不是指着他说‘扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万’吗？”</p>

<p>撒上31:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.</p>
<p>非利士人与以色列人争战。以色列人在非利士人面前逃跑，在基利波有被杀仆倒的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.</p>
<p>非利士人紧追扫罗和他儿子们，就杀了扫罗的儿子约拿单、亚比拿达、麦基舒亚。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.</p>
<p>势派甚大，扫罗被弓箭手追上，射伤甚重，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saul said to his armor-bearer, &quot;Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me.&quot; But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</p>
<p>就吩咐拿他兵器的人说：“你拔出刀来将我刺死，免得那些未受割礼的人来刺我、凌辱我。”但拿兵器的人甚惧怕，不肯刺他，扫罗就自己伏在刀上死了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him.</p>
<p>拿兵器的人见扫罗已死，也伏在刀上死了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day.</p>
<p>这样，扫罗和他三个儿子，与拿他兵器的人，以及跟随他的人，都一同死亡。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.</p>
<p>住平原那边并约旦河西的以色列人，见以色列军兵逃跑，扫罗和他儿子都死了，也就弃城逃跑。非利士人便来住在其中。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</p>
<p>次日，非利士人来剥那被杀之人的衣服，看见扫罗和他三个儿子仆倒在基利波山，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.</p>
<p>就割下他的首级，剥了他的军装，打发人到非利士地的四境（“到”或作“送到”），报信与他们庙里的偶像和众民；</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.</p>
<p>又将扫罗的军装放在亚斯她录庙里，将他的尸身钉在伯珊的城墙上。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard of what the Philistines had done to Saul,</p>
<p>基列雅比的居民听见非利士人向扫罗所行的事，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all their valiant men journeyed through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them.</p>
<p>他们中间所有的勇士就起身，走了一夜，将扫罗和他儿子的尸身从伯珊城墙上取下来，送到雅比那里用火烧了；</p>
</blockquote>
<p>撒上31:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.</p>
<p>将他们骸骨葬在雅比的垂丝柳树下，就禁食七日。</p>
