<p>路1:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</p>
<p>提阿非罗大人哪，有好些人提笔作书，述说在我们中间所成就的事，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</p>
<p>是照传道的人，从起初亲眼看见，又传给我们的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</p>
<p>这些事我既从起头都详细考察了，就定意要按着次序写给你，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</p>
<p>使你知道所学之道都是确实的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</p>
<p>当犹太王希律的时候，亚比雅班里有一个祭司，名叫撒迦利亚。他妻子是亚伦的后人，名叫伊利沙伯。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord&#x27;s commandments and regulations blamelessly.</p>
<p>他们二人在　神面前都是义人，遵行主的一切诫命礼仪，没有可指摘的；</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.</p>
<p>只是没有孩子，因为伊利沙伯不生育，两个人又年纪老迈了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once when Zechariah&#x27;s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</p>
<p>撒迦利亚按班次在　神面前供祭司的职分，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</p>
<p>照祭司的规矩掣签，得进主殿烧香。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</p>
<p>烧香的时候，众百姓在外面祷告。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</p>
<p>有主的使者站在香坛的右边向他显现。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</p>
<p>撒迦利亚看见，就惊慌害怕。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the angel said to him: &quot;Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</p>
<p>天使对他说：“撒迦利亚，不要害怕，因为你的祈祷已经被听见了。你的妻子伊利沙伯要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫约翰。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:14</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</p>
<p>你必欢喜快乐；有许多人因他出世，也必喜乐。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:15</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.</p>
<p>他在主面前将要为大，淡酒浓酒都不喝，从母腹里就被圣灵充满了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:16</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</p>
<p>他要使许多以色列人回转，归于主他们的　神。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧，又为主预备合用的百姓。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:18</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zechariah asked the angel, &quot;How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.&quot;</p>
<p>撒迦利亚对天使说：“我凭着什么可知道这事呢？我已经老了，我的妻子也年纪老迈了。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:19</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The angel answered, &quot;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</p>
<p>天使回答说：“我是站在　神面前的加百列，奉差而来对你说话，将这好信息报给你。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:20</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.&quot;</p>
<p>到了时候，这话必然应验。只因你不信，你必哑巴，不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:21</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</p>
<p>百姓等候撒迦利亚，诧异他许久在殿里。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:22</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</p>
<p>及至他出来，不能和他们说话，他们就知道他在殿里见了异象。因为他直向他们打手式，竟成了哑巴。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:23</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</p>
<p>他供职的日子已满，就回家去了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:24</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</p>
<p>这些日子以后，他的妻子伊利沙伯怀了孕，就隐藏了五个月，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Lord has done this for me,&quot; she said. &quot;In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.&quot;</p>
<p>说：“主在眷顾我的日子，这样看待我，要把我在人间的羞耻除掉。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:26</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</p>
<p>到了第六个月，天使加百列奉　神的差遣往加利利的一座城去，这城名叫拿撒勒，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:27</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin&#x27;s name was Mary.</p>
<p>到一个童女那里，是已经许配大卫家的一个人，名叫约瑟，童女的名字叫马利亚。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:28</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The angel went to her and said, &quot;Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.&quot;</p>
<p>天使进去，对她说：“蒙大恩的女子，我问你安，主和你同在了！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:29</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</p>
<p>马利亚因这话就很惊慌，又反复思想这样问安是什么意思。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:30</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the angel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.</p>
<p>天使对她说：“马利亚，不要怕！你在　神面前已经蒙恩了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:31</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</p>
<p>你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:32</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</p>
<p>他要为大，称为至高者的儿子，主　神要把他祖大卫的位给他。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:33</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.&quot;</p>
<p>他要作雅各家的王，直到永远；他的国也没有穷尽。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:34</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How will this be,&quot; Mary asked the angel, &quot;since I am a virgin?&quot;</p>
<p>马利亚对天使说：“我没有出嫁，怎么有这事呢？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:35</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The angel answered, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.</p>
<p>天使回答说：“圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你，因此所要生的圣者必称为　神的儿子（或作：“所要生的，必称为圣，称为　神的儿子”）。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:36</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</p>
<p>况且你的亲戚伊利沙伯，在年老的时候也怀了男胎，就是那素来称为不生育的，现在有孕六个月了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:37</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For nothing is impossible with God.&quot;</p>
<p>因为出于　神的话，没有一句不带能力的。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:38</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am the Lord&#x27;s servant,&quot; Mary answered. &quot;May it be to me as you have said.&quot; Then the angel left her.</p>
<p>马利亚说：“我是主的使女，情愿照你的话成就在我身上。”天使就离开她去了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:39</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</p>
<p>那时候马利亚起身，急忙往山地里去，来到犹大的一座城。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:40</p>
<blockquote>
<p>where she entered Zechariah&#x27;s home and greeted Elizabeth.</p>
<p>进了撒迦利亚的家，问伊利沙伯安。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:41</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Elizabeth heard Mary&#x27;s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>以利沙伯一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动。以利沙伯且被圣灵充满，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>路1:42</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a loud voice she exclaimed: &quot;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</p>
