<p>王下1:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Ahab&#x27;s death, Moab rebelled against Israel.</p>
<p>亚哈死后，摩押背叛以色列。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, &quot;Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.&quot;</p>
<p>亚哈谢在撒马利亚，一日，从楼上的栏杆里掉下来，就病了；于是差遣使者说：“你们去问以革伦的　神巴力西卜，我这病能好不能好？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, &quot;Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, &#x27;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?&#x27;</p>
<p>但耶和华的使者对提斯比人以利亚说：“你起来，去迎着撒马利亚王的使者，对他们说：‘你们去问以革伦　神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神吗？’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore this is what the LORD says: &#x27;You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&#x27;&quot; So Elijah went.</p>
<p>所以耶和华如此说：‘你必不下你所上的床，必定要死！’”以利亚就去了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, &quot;Why have you come back?&quot;</p>
<p>使者回来见王，王问他们说：“你们为什么回来呢？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A man came to meet us,&quot; they replied. &quot;And he said to us, &#x27;Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, &quot;This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&quot; &#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>使者回答说：“有一个人迎着我们来，对我们说：‘你们回去见差你们来的王，对他说：耶和华如此说：你差人去问以革伦　神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神吗？所以，你必不下所上的床，必定要死！’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king asked them, &quot;What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?&quot;</p>
<p>王问他们说：“迎着你们来告诉你们这话的，是怎样的人？”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They replied, &quot;He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist.&quot; The king said, &quot;That was Elijah the Tishbite.&quot;</p>
<p>回答说：“他身穿毛衣，腰束皮带。”王说：“这必是提斯比人以利亚。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &quot;Man of God, the king says, &#x27;Come down!&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>于是，王差遣五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚，他就上到以利亚那里；以利亚正坐在山顶上。五十夫长对他说：“神人哪，王吩咐你下来！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elijah answered the captain, &quot;If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!&quot; Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.</p>
<p>以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人！”于是有火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, &quot;Man of God, this is what the king says, &#x27;Come down at once!&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>王第二次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去见以利亚。五十夫长对以利亚说：“神人哪，王吩咐你快快下来！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If I am a man of God,&quot; Elijah replied, &quot;may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!&quot; Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.</p>
<p>以利亚回答说：“我若是神人，愿火从天上降下来，烧灭你和你那五十人！”于是　神的火从天上降下来，烧灭五十夫长和他那五十人。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. &quot;Man of God,&quot; he begged, &quot;please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!</p>
<p>王第三次差遣一个五十夫长，带领五十人去。这五十夫长上去，双膝跪在以利亚面前，哀求他说：“神人哪，愿我的性命和你这五十个仆人的性命在你眼前看为宝贵。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:14</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!&quot;</p>
<p>已经有火从天上降下来，烧灭前两次来的五十夫长和他们各自带的五十人；现在愿我的性命在你眼前看为宝贵。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:15</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, &quot;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&quot; So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.</p>
<p>耶和华的使者对以利亚说：“你同着他下去，不要怕他。”以利亚就起来，同着他下去见王，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:16</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He told the king, &quot;This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!&quot;</p>
<p>对王说：“耶和华如此说：你差人去问以革伦　神巴力西卜，岂因以色列中没有　神可以求问吗？所以你必不下所上的床，必定要死！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.</p>
<p>亚哈谢果然死了，正如耶和华藉以利亚所说的话。因他没有儿子，他兄弟约兰接续他作王，正在犹大王约沙法的儿子约兰第二年。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下1:18</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for all the other events of Ahaziah&#x27;s reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>亚哈谢其余所行的事都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>

<p>王下2:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.</p>
<p>耶和华要用旋风接以利亚升天的时候，以利亚与以利沙从吉甲前往。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elijah said to Elisha, &quot;Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel.&quot; But Elisha said, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.&quot; So they went down to Bethel.</p>
<p>以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差我往伯特利去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人下到伯特利。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, &quot;Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?&quot; &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Elisha replied, &quot;but do not speak of it.&quot;</p>
<p>住伯特利的先知门徒出来见以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道！你们不要作声。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Elijah said to him, &quot;Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho.&quot; And he replied, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.&quot; So they went to Jericho.</p>
<p>以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往耶利哥去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人到了耶利哥。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, &quot;Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?&quot; &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; he replied, &quot;but do not speak of it.&quot;</p>
<p>住耶利哥的先知门徒就近以利沙，对他说：“耶和华今日要接你的师傅离开你，你知道不知道？”他说：“我知道！你们不要作声。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Elijah said to him, &quot;Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan.&quot; And he replied, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.&quot; So the two of them walked on.</p>
<p>以利亚对以利沙说：“耶和华差遣我往约旦河去，你可以在这里等候。”以利沙说：“我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。”于是二人一同前往。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.</p>
<p>有先知门徒去了五十人，远远地站在他们对面，二人在约旦河边站住。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.</p>
<p>以利亚将自己的外衣卷起来，用以打水，水就左右分开，二人走干地而过。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下2:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, &quot;Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?&quot; &quot;Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,&quot; Elisha replied.</p>
<p>过去之后，以利亚对以利沙说：“我未曾被接去离开你，你要我为你做什么，只管求我。”以利沙说：“愿感动你的灵加倍地感动我。”</p>

<p>王下7:1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elisha said, &quot;Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the LORD says: About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.&quot;</p>
<p>以利沙说：“你们要听耶和华的话。耶和华如此说：明日约到这时候，在撒马利亚城门口，一细亚细面要卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也要卖银一舍客勒。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, &quot;Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?&quot; &quot;You will see it with your own eyes,&quot; answered Elisha, &quot;but you will not eat any of it!&quot;</p>
<p>有一个搀扶王的军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”以利沙说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, &quot;Why stay here until we die?</p>
<p>在城门那里有四个长大麻疯的人，他们彼此说：“我们为何坐在这里等死呢？</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we say, &#x27;We&#x27;ll go into the city&#x27;--the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let&#x27;s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.&quot;</p>
<p>我们若说‘进城去吧’，城里有饥荒，必死在那里；若在这里坐着不动，也必是死。来吧！我们去投降亚兰人的军队，他们若留我们的活命，就活着；若杀我们，就死了吧！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, not a man was there,</p>
<p>黄 昏的时候，他们起来往亚兰人的营盘去；到了营边，不见一人在那里。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, &quot;Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!&quot;</p>
<p>因为主使亚兰人的军队听见车马的声音，是大军的声音。他们就彼此说：“这必是以色列王贿买赫人的诸王和埃及人的诸王来攻击我们。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.</p>
<p>所以，在黄昏的时候，他们起来逃跑，撇下帐棚、马、驴，营盘照旧，只顾逃命。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents. They ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.</p>
<p>那些长大麻疯的到了营边，进了帐棚，吃了喝了，且从其中拿出金银和衣服来，去收藏了；回来又进了一座帐棚，从其中拿出财物来，去收藏了。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they said to each other, &quot;We&#x27;re not doing right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let&#x27;s go at once and report this to the royal palace.&quot;</p>
<p>那时，他们彼此说：“我们所做的不好！今日是有好信息的日子，我们竟不作声！若等到天亮，罪必临到我们。来吧，我们与王家报信去！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:10</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, &quot;We went into the Aramean camp and not a man was there--not a sound of anyone--only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.&quot;</p>
<p>他们就去叫守城门的，告诉他们说：“我们到了亚兰人的营，不见一人在那里，也无人声，只有拴着的马和驴，帐棚都照旧。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.</p>
<p>守城门的叫了众守门的人来，他们就进去与王家报信。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king got up in the night and said to his officers, &quot;I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, &#x27;They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>王夜间起来，对臣仆说：“我告诉你们亚兰人向我们如何行：他们知道我们饥饿，所以离营，埋伏在田野说：‘以色列人出城的时候，我们就活捉他们，得以进城。’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of his officers answered, &quot;Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here--yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.&quot;</p>
<p>有一个臣仆对王说：“我们不如用城里剩下之马中的五匹马（马和城里剩下的以色列人都是一样，快要灭绝），打发人去窥探。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:14</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, &quot;Go and find out what has happened.&quot;</p>
<p>于是取了两辆车和马，王差人去追寻亚兰军说：“你们去窥探窥探。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:15</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.</p>
<p>他们就追寻到约旦河，看见满道上都是亚兰人急跑时丢弃的衣服器具。使者就回来报告王。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:16</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the LORD had said.</p>
<p>众人就出去，掳掠亚兰人的营盘。于是一细亚细面卖银一舍客勒，二细亚大麦也卖银一舍客勒，正如耶和华所说的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.</p>
<p>王派搀扶他的那军长，在城门口弹压，众人在那里将他践踏，他就死了，正如神人在王下来见他的时候所说的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:18</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It happened as the man of God had said to the king: &quot;About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria.&quot;</p>
<p>神人曾对王说：“明日约到这时候，在撒马利亚城门口，二细亚大麦要卖银一舍客勒，一细亚细面也要卖银一舍客勒。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下7:19</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The officer had said to the man of God, &quot;Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?&quot; The man of God had replied, &quot;You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!&quot;</p>
<p>那军长对神人说：“即便耶和华使天开了窗户，也不能有这事。”神人说：“你必亲眼看见，却不得吃。”</p>

<p>王下7:20</p>

<p>And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.</p>
<p>这话果然应验在他身上，因为众人在城门口将他践踏，他就死了。</p>

<p>Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, &quot;Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the LORD has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years.&quot;</p>
<p>以利沙曾对所救活之子的那妇人说：“你和你的全家，要起身往你可住的地方去住，因为耶和华命饥荒降在这地七年。”</p>

<p>王下8:2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.</p>
<p>妇人就起身，照神人的话，带着全家往非利士地去，住了七年。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下8:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land.</p>
<p>七年完了，那妇人从非利士地回来，就出去为自己的房屋田地哀告王。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下8:4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, &quot;Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.&quot;</p>
<p>那时，王正与神人的仆人基哈西说：“请你将以利沙所行的一切大事告诉我。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下8:5</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, &quot;This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.&quot;</p>
<p>基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使 死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活她儿子的那妇人，为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说：“我主我王，这就是那妇人，这是她的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。”</p>

<p>王下8:6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, &quot;Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.&quot;</p>
<p>王问那妇人，她就把那事告诉王。于是王为她派一个太监，说：“凡属这妇人的都还给她，自从她离开本地直到今日，她田地的出产也都还给她。”</p>

<p>Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, &quot;The man of God has come all the way up here,&quot;</p>
<p>以利沙来到大马色，亚兰王便哈达正患病。有人告诉王说：“神人来到这里了。”</p>

<p>王下8:12</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Why is my lord weeping?&quot; asked Hazael. &quot;Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,&quot; he answered. &quot;You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.&quot;</p>
<p>哈薛说：“我主为什么哭？”回答说：“因为我知道你必苦害以色列人，用火焚烧他们的保障，用刀杀死他们的壮丁，摔死他们的婴孩，剖开他们的孕妇。”</p>

<p>Hazael said, &quot;How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?&quot; &quot;The LORD has shown me that you will become king of Aram,&quot; answered Elisha.</p>

<p>王下24:18</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother&#x27;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</p>
<p>西底家登基的时候年二十一岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年。他母亲名叫哈慕她，是立拿人耶利米的女儿。</p>

<p>王下24:19</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.</p>
<p>西底家行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，是照约雅敬一切所行的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下24:20</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was because of the LORD&#x27;S anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>因此，耶和华的怒气在耶路撒冷和犹大发作，以致将人民从自己面前赶出。</p>

<p>西底家背叛巴比伦王。他作王第九年十月初十日，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领全军来攻击耶路撒冷，对城安营 ，四围筑垒攻城。</p>

</blockquote>
<p>王下25:17</p>

<p>王下25:23</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, and their men.</p>
<p>众军长和属他们的人听见巴比伦王立了基大利作省长，于是军长尼探雅的儿子以实玛利、加利亚的儿子约哈难、尼陀法人单户篾的儿子西莱雅、玛迦人的儿子雅撒尼亚和属他们的人，都到米斯巴见基大利。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下25:24</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. &quot;Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials,&quot; he said. &quot;Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.&quot;</p>
<p>基大利向他们和属他们的人起誓说：“你们不必惧怕迦勒底臣仆，只管住在这地，服事巴比伦王，就可以得福。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>王下25:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this, all the people from the least to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.</p>
<p>于是，众民无论大小，连众军长，因为惧怕迦勒底人，都起身往埃及去了。</p>
