During our waking hours, our cells are busy using up our day's energy sources, which get broken down into various byproducts, including adenosine. As adenosine builds up, it increases the urge to sleep, also know as sleep pressure. In fact, caffeine works by blocking adenosine's receptor pathways. Other waste products also build up in the brain, and if they're not cleared away, they collectively overload the brain, and are thought to lead to the many negative symptoms of sleep deprivation."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"\u5931\u7720\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5982\u6b64\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u75db\u82e6\u7684\uff1f\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65f6\u4ee3\u8c22\u7269\u5728\u5927\u8111\u4e2d\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002\u5728\u6e05\u9192\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0d\u505c\u5730\u6d88\u8017\u4e00\u5929\u7684\u6240\u9700\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u4ee3\u8c22\u7269\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u817a\u82d4\uff0c\u5f53\u817a\u82d4\u7d2f\u8ba1\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u56f0\u5026\u611f\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u7761\u7720\u538b\u529b\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5496\u5561\u56e0\u662f\u9760\u963b\u65ad\u63a5\u53d7\u817a\u82d4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u5b98\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u4ee3\u8c22\u7269\u4e5f\u4f1a\u79ef\u805a\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u6e05\u7406\u51fa\u53bb\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u8111\u548c\u601d\u60f3\u8d85\u8d1f\u8377\u8fd0\u8f6c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u5404\u79cd\u5931\u7720\u75c7\u72b6\u3002"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.h4,{id:"so-whats-happening-in-our-brain-when-we-sleep-to-prevent-this-scientists-found-something-called-the-glymphatic-system-a-clean-up-mechanism-that-removes-this-buildup-and-is-much-more-active-when-were-asleep-it-works-by-using-cerebrospinal-fluid-to-flush-away-toxic-byproduct-that-accumulate-between-cells-lymphatic-vessels-which-serve-as-pathways-for-immune-cells-have-recently-been-discovered-in-the-brain-and-they-may-also-play-a-role-in-clearing-out-the-brains-daily-waste-products",children:["So, what's happening in our brain when we sleep to prevent this?
