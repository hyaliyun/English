At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on.

I had no experience in this <code>realm</code> with my grandparents and no way to <code>gauge</code> what the <code>consequences</code> might be. We stopped beside the trailer.

At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother. I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on.

I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do. While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway. He got out of the car and came around and opended my door and waited for me to follow. Was I in trouble? My grandfather was a highly intelligent, quiet man. He has never said a harsh word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time? Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother.
