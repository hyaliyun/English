In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell, who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads, suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles. It was the idea of supporting a craft on a \'pad\', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air. Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, or land vehicles -- for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft. As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship\'s power and limits its speed. His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by making it ride on a cushion of air, no more than one or two feet thick. This is done by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft. It \'flies\', therefore, but it cannot fly higher -- its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 29 Funnny or not? \u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-Funnny-or-not_-\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 3 An unknown goddess \u65e0\u540d\u5973\u795e","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-3-An-unknown-goddess-\u65e0\u540d\u5973\u795e"}}');var o=t(74848),s=t(28453);const i={},a="Lesson 29 The hovercraft \u6c14\u57ab\u8239",h={},c=[{value:"Notes on the text \u8bfe\u6587\u6ce8\u91ca",id:"notes-on-the-text-\u8bfe\u6587\u6ce8\u91ca",level:3},{value:"\u53c2\u8003\u8bd1\u6587",id:"\u53c2\u8003\u8bd1\u6587",level:3}];function l(e){const n={code:"code",h1:"h1",h3:"h3",header:"header",li:"li",ol:"ol",p:"p",pre:"pre",...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return(0,o.jsxs)(o.Fragment,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(n.header,{children:(0,o.jsx)(n.h1,{id:"lesson-29-the-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239",children:"Lesson 29 The hovercraft \u6c14\u57ab\u8239"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Many strange new means of transport have been developed in our century, the strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft.
