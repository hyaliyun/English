As the time and cost of making a chip drop to a few days and a few hundred dollars, engineers may soon be free to let their imaginations soar without being penalized by expensive failures. Mead predicts that inventors will be able to perfect powerful customized chips over a weekend at the office -- spawning a new generation of garage start-ups and giving the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. \'We\'ve got more garages with smart people,\' Mead observes. \'We really thrive on anarchy.\'","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-Silicon-valley-\u7845\u8c37.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-Silicon-valley-\u7845\u8c37","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-Silicon-valley-\u7845\u8c37","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-Silicon-valley-\u7845\u8c37.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 1 Finding fossil man \u53d1\u73b0\u5316\u77f3\u4eba","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-1-Finding-fossil-man-\u53d1\u73b0\u5316\u77f3\u4eba"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic \uff02\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-The-loss-of-the-Titanic-\uff02\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-The-loss-of-the-Titanic-\uff02\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1","title":"Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic \uff02\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1","description":"The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912.

In the young there is a justification for this feeling. Young men who have reason to fear that they will be killed in battle may justifiably feel bitter in the thought that they have been cheated of the best things that life has to offer. But in an old man who has known human joys and sorrows, and has achieved whatever work it was in him to do, the fear of death is somewhat abject and ignoble. The best way to overcome it -- so at least it seems to me -- is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. An individual human existence should be like a river -- small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past boulders and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. The man who, in old age, can see his life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death, since the things he cares for will continue. And if, with the decay of vitality, weariness increases, the thought of rest will be not unwelcome. I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and content in the thought that what was possible has been done.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-How-to-grow-old-\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u5ea6\u665a\u5e74.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-How-to-grow-old-\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u5ea6\u665a\u5e74","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-How-to-grow-old-\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u5ea6\u665a\u5e74","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-How-to-grow-old-\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u5ea6\u665a\u5e74.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 10 The loss of the Titanic \uff02\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-10-The-loss-of-the-Titanic-\uff02\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 11 Not guilty \u65e0\u7f6a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-Not-guilty-\u65e0\u7f6a"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-Not-guilty-\u65e0\u7f6a","title":"Lesson 11 Not guilty \u65e0\u7f6a","description":"Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare.

Primarily, the banker-customer relationship is that of debtor and creditor -- who is which depending on whether the customer\'s account is in credit or is overdrawn. But, in addition to that basically simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another. Many of these obligations can give rise to problems and complications but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, cannot complain that the law is loaded against him. The bank must obey its customer\'s instructions, and not those of anyone else. When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques drawn by himself. He gives the bank specimens of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer\'s money on a cheque on which its customer\'s signature has been forged. It makes no difference that the forgery may have been a very skillful one: the bank must recognize its customer\'s signature. For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice, adopted by banks, of printing the customer\'s name on his cheques. If this facilitates forgery, it is the bank which will lose, not the customer.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-12-Banks-and-their-customers-\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u987e\u5ba2.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-12-Banks-and-their-customers-\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u987e\u5ba2","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-12-Banks-and-their-customers-\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u987e\u5ba2","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-12-Banks-and-their-customers-\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u987e\u5ba2.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 11 Not guilty \u65e0\u7f6a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-11-Not-guilty-\u65e0\u7f6a"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 12 Life on a desert island \u8352\u5c9b\u751f\u6d3b","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-12-Life-on-a-desert-island-\u8352\u5c9b\u751f\u6d3b"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-12-Life-on-a-desert-island-\u8352\u5c9b\u751f\u6d3b","title":"Lesson 12 Life on a desert island \u8352\u5c9b\u751f\u6d3b","description":"Most of us have formed an unrealistic picture of life on a desert island.

One is the general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out, the other the lack of freedom of the individual research worker.In so far as any inquiry is a secret one, it naturally limits all those engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists either in other countries or in universities, or even, often enough, in other departments of the same firm. The degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably. Some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to them not to keep them secret. Yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete secrecy until the stage at which patents can be taken out. Even more processes are never patented at all but kept as secret processes. This applies particularly to chemical industries, where chance discoveries play a much larger part than they do in physical and mechanical industries. Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole nature of the research cannot be mentioned. Many firms, for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining technical or scientific books from libraries because they are unwilling to have their names entered as having taken out such and such a book, for fear the agents of other firms should be able to trace the kind of research they are likely to be undertaking.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-15-Secrecy-in-industry-\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-15-Secrecy-in-industry-\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-15-Secrecy-in-industry-\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-15-Secrecy-in-industry-\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 15 Fifty pence worth of trouble \u4e94\u5341\u4fbf\u58eb\u7684\u9ebb\u70e6","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-15-Fifty-pence-worth-of-trouble-\u4e94\u5341\u4fbf\u58eb\u7684\u9ebb\u70e6"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb \u739b\u4e3d\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u5c0f\u7f94\u7f8a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-Mary-had-a-little-lamb-\u739b\u4e3d\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u5c0f\u7f94\u7f8a"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-Mary-had-a-little-lamb-\u739b\u4e3d\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u5c0f\u7f94\u7f8a","title":"Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb \u739b\u4e3d\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u5c0f\u7f94\u7f8a","description":"Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece.

Modern industry is based on the conception of the maximum production at lowest cost, in order that an individual or a group of individuals may earn as much money as possible. It has expanded without any idea of the true nature of the human beings who run the machines, and without giving any consideration to the effects produced on the individuals and on their descendants by the artificial mode of existence imposed by the factory. The great cities have been built with no regard for us. The shape and dimensions of the skyscrapers depend entirely on the necessity of obtaining the maximum income per square foot of ground, and of offering to the tenants offices and apartments that please them. This caused the construction of gigantic buildings where too large masses of human beings are crowded together. Civilised men like such a way of living. While they enjoy the comfort and banal luxury of their dwelling, they do not realise that they are deprived of the necessities of life. The modern city consists of monstrous edifices and of dark, narrow streets full of petrol fumes and toxic gases, torn by the noise of the taxicabs, lorries and buses, and thronged ceaselessly by great crowds. Obviously, it has not been planned for the good of its inhabitants.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-The-modern-city-\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-The-modern-city-\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-The-modern-city-\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-The-modern-city-\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 16 Mary had a little lamb \u739b\u4e3d\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u5c0f\u7f94\u7f8a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-Mary-had-a-little-lamb-\u739b\u4e3d\u6709\u4e00\u5934\u5c0f\u7f94\u7f8a"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 17 A man-made disease \u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5","title":"Lesson 17 A man-made disease \u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5","description":"In the early days of the settlement of Australia,enterprising settlers unwisely introduced the European rabbit. This rabbit had no natural enemies in the Antipodes, so that it multiplied with that promiscuous abandon characteristic of rabbits. It overran a whole continent. It caused devastation by burrowing and by devouring the herbage which might have maintained millions of sheep and cattle. Scientists discovered that this particular variety of rabbit (and apparently no other animal) was susceptible to a fatal virus disease, myxomatosis. By infecting animals and letting them loose in the burrows, local epidemics of this disease could be created. Later it was found that there was a type of mosquito which acted as the carrier of this disease and passed it on to the rabbits. So while the rest of the world was trying to get rid of mosquitoes, Australia was encouraging this one. It effectively spread the disease all over the continent and drastically reduced the rabbit population. It later became apparent that rabbits were developing a degree of resistance to this disease, so that the rabbit population was unlikely to be completely exterminated. There were hopes, however, that the problem of the rabbit would become manageable.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 16 The modern city \u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-16-The-modern-city-\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-The-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-The-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world","title":"Lesson 17 The longest suspension bridge in the world","description":"Verrazano, an Italian about whom little is known, sailed into New","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-The-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-The-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-The-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-The-longest-suspension-bridge-in-the-world.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 17 A man-made disease \u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-17-A-man-made-disease-\u4eba\u4e3a\u7684\u75be\u75c5"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 18 Electric currents in modern art \u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Electric-currents-in-modern-art-\u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Electric-currents-in-modern-art-\u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41","title":"Lesson 18 Electric currents in modern art \u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41","description":"Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more.

Marine Studio biologists have pointed out that, however intelligent they may be, it is probably a mistake to credit dolphins with any motive of lifesaving. On the occasions when they have pushed to shore an unconscious human being they have much more likely done it out of curiosity or for sport, as in riding the bow waves of a ship. In 1928 some porpoises were photographed working like beavers to push ashore a waterlogged mattress. If, as has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks. Porpoises and sharks are natural enemies. It is possible that upon such an occasion a battle ensued, with the sharks being driven away or killed.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Porpoises-\u6d77\u8c5a.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Porpoises-\u6d77\u8c5a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Porpoises-\u6d77\u8c5a","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Porpoises-\u6d77\u8c5a.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 18 Electric currents in modern art \u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-18-Electric-currents-in-modern-art-\u73b0\u4ee3\u827a\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 19 A very dear cat \u4e00\u53ea\u8d35\u91cd\u7684\u5b9d\u8d1d\u732b","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-19-A-very-dear-cat-\u4e00\u53ea\u8d35\u91cd\u7684\u5b9d\u8d1d\u732b"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-19-A-very-dear-cat-\u4e00\u53ea\u8d35\u91cd\u7684\u5b9d\u8d1d\u732b","title":"Lesson 19 A very dear cat \u4e00\u53ea\u8d35\u91cd\u7684\u5b9d\u8d1d\u732b","description":"Kidnappers are rarely interested in animals, but they recently took considerable interest in Mrs. Eleanor Ramsay\'s cat.

Over the periods their saliva, a mild, digestive juice like our own, was converted into a poison that defies analysis even today. It was not forced upon them by the survival competition; they could have caught and lived on prey without using poison, just as the thousands of non-poisonous snakes still do. Poison to a snake is merely a luxury; it enables it to get its food with very little effort, no more effort than one bite. And why only snakes? Cats, for instance, would be greatly helped; no running fights with large, fierce rats or tussles with grown rabbits -- just a bite and no more effort needed. In fact, it would be an assistance to all carnivores though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other. But, of the vertebrates, unpredictable Nature selected only snakes (and one lizard).

Surely because progress of a particular kind is actually taking place around us and is becoming more and more manifest. Although mankind has undergone no general improvement in intelligence or morality, it has made extraordinary progress in the accumulation of knowledge. Knowledge began to increase as soon as the thoughts of one individual could be communicated to another by means of speech. With the invention of writing, a great advance was made, for knowledge could then be not only communicated but also stored. Libraries made education possible, and education in its turn added to libraries What is going to be done with all this knowledge? As is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil. It is now being used indifferently for both. Could any spectacle, for instance, be more grimly whimsical than that of gunners using science to shatter men\'s bodies while, close at hand, surgeons use it to restore them?

Any ship that crosses the Pacific is accompanied for many days by the smaller albatross, which may keep company with the vessel for an hour without visible or more than occasional movement of wing. The currents of air that the walls of the ship direct upwards, as well as in the line of its course, are enough to give the great bird with its immense wings sufficient sustenance and progress. The albatross is the king of the gliders, the class of fliers which harness the air to their purpose, but must yield to its opposition. In the contrary school, the duck is supreme. It comes nearer to the engines with which man has \'conquered\' the air, as he boasts. Duck, and like them the pigeons, are endowed with steel-like muscles, that are a good part of the weight of the bird, and these will ply the short wings with such irresistible power that they can bore for long distances through an opposing gale before exhaustion follows. Their humbler followers, such as partridges, have a like power of strong propulsion, but soon tire. You may pick them up in utter exhaustion, if wind over the sea has driven them to a long journey. The swallow shares the virtues of both schools in highest measure. It tires not, nor does it boast of its power; but belongs to the air,travelling it may be 6,000 miles to and from its northern nesting home, feeding its flown young as it flies, and slipping through a medium that seems to help its passage even when the wind is adverse. Such birds do us good, though we no longer take omens from their flight on this side and that; and even the most superstitious villagers no longer take off their hats to the magpie and wish it good-morning.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-23-Bird-flight-\u9e1f\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-23-Bird-flight-\u9e1f\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-23-Bird-flight-\u9e1f\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-23-Bird-flight-\u9e1f\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 23  One man\'s meat is another man\'s poison","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-23--One-man\'s-meat-is-another-man\'s-poison"},"next":{"title":"Lessons24 A skeleton in the cupboard","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-A-skeleton-in-the-cupboard"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-A-skeleton-in-the-cupboard","title":"Lessons24 A skeleton in the cupboard","description":"We often read in novels how a seemingly respectable person or family has some terrible secret which has been concealed from strangers for years.

The reader\'s hair stands on end when he reads in the final pages of the novel that the heroine, a dear old lady who had always been so kind to everybody, had, in her youth, poisoned every one of her five husbands.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-A-skeleton-in-the-cupboard.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-A-skeleton-in-the-cupboard","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-A-skeleton-in-the-cupboard","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-A-skeleton-in-the-cupboard.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 23 Bird flight \u9e1f\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-23-Bird-flight-\u9e1f\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 24 Beauty \u7f8e","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-Beauty-\u7f8e"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-Beauty-\u7f8e","title":"Lesson 24 Beauty \u7f8e","description":"A young man sees a sunset and, unable to understand or to express the emotion that it rouses in him, concludes that it must be the gateway to a world that lies beyond.

On the other hand, those who dislike noise will sometimes use most inadequate evidence to support their pleas for a quieter society. This is a pity, because noise abatement really is a good cause. and it is likely to be discredited if it gets to be associated with bad science. One allegation often made is that noise produces mental illness. A recent article in a weekly newspaper, for instance, was headed with a striking illustration of a lady in a state of considerable distress, with the caption \'She was yet another victim, reduced to a screaming wreck \'. On turning eagerly to the text, one learns that the lady was a typist who found the sound of office typewriters worried her more and more until eventually she had to go into a mental hospital. Now the snag in this sort of anecdote is of course that one cannot distinguish cause and effect. Was the noise a cause of the illness, or were the complaints about noise merely a symptom? Another patient might equally well complain that her neighbours were combining to slander her and persecute her, and yet one might be cautious about believing this statement.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-Non-auditory-effects-of-noise.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-Non-auditory-effects-of-noise","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-Non-auditory-effects-of-noise","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-Non-auditory-effects-of-noise.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 24 Beauty \u7f8e","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-24-Beauty-\u7f8e"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark \uff02\u5361\u8482\u8428\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u5e06\u8239","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-The-Cutty-Sark-\uff02\u5361\u8482\u8428\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u5e06\u8239"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-The-Cutty-Sark-\uff02\u5361\u8482\u8428\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u5e06\u8239","title":"Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark \uff02\u5361\u8482\u8428\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u5e06\u8239","description":"One of the most famous sailing ships of the nineteenth century, the Cutty Sark, can still be seen at Greenwich.

The Cutty Sark was one c. . . . e fastest sailing ships that has ever been built. The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae. Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England. This race, which went on for exactly four months, was the last of its kind.

But even in the most favourable circumstances only a small fraction of the creatures that die are preserved in this way before decay sets in or, even more likely, before scavengers eat them. After all, all living creatures live by feeding on something else, whether it be plant or animal, dead or alive, and it is only by chance that such a fate is avoided. The remains of plants and animals that lived on land are much more rarely preserved, for there is seldom anything to cover them over. When you think of the innumerable birds that one sees flying about, not to mention the equally numerous small animals like field mice and voles which you do not see, it is very rarely that one comes across a dead body, except, of course, on the roads. They decompose and are quickly destroyed by the weather or eaten by some other creature.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-26-The-past-life-of-the-earth-\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u6614\u65e5\u751f\u547d.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-26-The-past-life-of-the-earth-\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u6614\u65e5\u751f\u547d","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-26-The-past-life-of-the-earth-\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u6614\u65e5\u751f\u547d","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-26-The-past-life-of-the-earth-\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u6614\u65e5\u751f\u547d.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 25 The Cutty Sark \uff02\u5361\u8482\u8428\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u5e06\u8239","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-25-The-Cutty-Sark-\uff02\u5361\u8482\u8428\u514b\uff02\u53f7\u5e06\u8239"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 26 Wanted: a large biscuit tin \u5f81\u8d2d\u5927\u513f\u7ae5\u8282\u5e72\u7b52","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-26-Wanted_-a-large-biscuit-tin-\u5f81\u8d2d\u5927\u513f\u7ae5\u8282\u5e72\u7b52"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-26-Wanted_-a-large-biscuit-tin-\u5f81\u8d2d\u5927\u513f\u7ae5\u8282\u5e72\u7b52","title":"Lesson 26 Wanted: a large biscuit tin \u5f81\u8d2d\u5927\u513f\u7ae5\u8282\u5e72\u7b52","description":"No one can avoid being influenced by advertisements.

There is no quicker method of disposing of patients than by giving them what they are asking for, and since most medical men in the Health Services are overworked and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits etc., the bottle, the box, and the jar are almost always granted them.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-28-Patients-and-doctors-\u75c5\u4eba\u4e0e\u533b\u751f.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-28-Patients-and-doctors-\u75c5\u4eba\u4e0e\u533b\u751f","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-28-Patients-and-doctors-\u75c5\u4eba\u4e0e\u533b\u751f","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-28-Patients-and-doctors-\u75c5\u4eba\u4e0e\u533b\u751f.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 28 Five pounds too dear \u4e94\u9551\u4e5f\u592a\u8d35","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-28-Five-pounds-too-dear-\u4e94\u9551\u4e5f\u592a\u8d35"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 29 Funnny or not? \u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-Funnny-or-not_-\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-Funnny-or-not_-\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f","title":"Lesson 29 Funnny or not? \u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f","description":"Whether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on where we have been brought up.

In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell, who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads, suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles. It was the idea of supporting a craft on a \'pad\', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air. Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, or land vehicles -- for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft. As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship\'s power and limits its speed. His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by making it ride on a cushion of air, no more than one or two feet thick. This is done by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft. It \'flies\', therefore, but it cannot fly higher -- its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-The-hovercraft-\u6c14\u57ab\u8239.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 29 Funnny or not? \u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-29-Funnny-or-not_-\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7b11\uff1f"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 3 An unknown goddess \u65e0\u540d\u5973\u795e","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-3-An-unknown-goddess-\u65e0\u540d\u5973\u795e"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-3-An-unknown-goddess-\u65e0\u540d\u5973\u795e","title":"Lesson 3 An unknown goddess \u65e0\u540d\u5973\u795e","description":"Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea.

Sir James Clark Ross had obtained a sounding of over 2,400 fathoms in 1839, but it was not until 1869, when H.M.S. Porcupine was put at the disposal of the Royal Society for several cruises, that a series of deep soundings was obtained in the Atlantic and the first samples were collected by dredging the bottom. Shortly after this the famous H. M. S. Challenger expedition established the study of the sea-floor as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists. A burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables soon confirmed the challenger\'s observation that many parts of the ocean were two to three miles deep, and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-30-Exploring-the-sea-floor-\u6d77\u5e95\u52d8\u63a2.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-30-Exploring-the-sea-floor-\u6d77\u5e95\u52d8\u63a2","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-30-Exploring-the-sea-floor-\u6d77\u5e95\u52d8\u63a2","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-30-Exploring-the-sea-floor-\u6d77\u5e95\u52d8\u63a2.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 3 Matterhorn man \u9a6c\u7279\u970d\u6069\u5c71\u533a\u4eba","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-3-Matterhorn-man-\u9a6c\u7279\u970d\u6069\u5c71\u533a\u4eba"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 30 The death of a ghost \u5e7d\u7075\u4e4b\u6b7b","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-30-The-death-of-a-ghost-\u5e7d\u7075\u4e4b\u6b7b"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-30-The-death-of-a-ghost-\u5e7d\u7075\u4e4b\u6b7b","title":"Lesson 30 The death of a ghost \u5e7d\u7075\u4e4b\u6b7b","description":"For years, villagers believed that Endley Farm was haunted.

He was, above all, a man who experimented: who despised the prejudices and book learning of the Aristotelians, who put his questions to nature instead of to the ancients, and who drew his conclusions fearlessly. He had been the first to turn a telescope to the sky, and he had seen their evidence enough to overthrow Aristotle and Ptolemy together. He was the man who climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropped various weights from the top, who rolled balls down inclined planes, and then generalized the results of his many experiments into the famous law of free fall.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-32-Galileo-reborn-\u4f3d\u5229\u7565\u7684\u590d\u751f.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-32-Galileo-reborn-\u4f3d\u5229\u7565\u7684\u590d\u751f","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-32-Galileo-reborn-\u4f3d\u5229\u7565\u7684\u590d\u751f","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-32-Galileo-reborn-\u4f3d\u5229\u7565\u7684\u590d\u751f.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 32 A lost ship \u4e00\u8258\u6c89\u8239","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-32-A-lost-ship-\u4e00\u8258\u6c89\u8239"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 33 A day to remember \u96be\u5fd8\u7684\u4e00\u5929","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-33-A-day-to-remember-\u96be\u5fd8\u7684\u4e00\u5929"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-33-A-day-to-remember-\u96be\u5fd8\u7684\u4e00\u5929","title":"Lesson 33 A day to remember \u96be\u5fd8\u7684\u4e00\u5929","description":"We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.

Education, with its cycles of instruction so carefully worked out, punctuated by textbooks -- those purchasable wells of wisdom - what would civilization be like without its benefits? So much is certain: that we would have doctors and preachers, lawyers and defendants, marriages and births -- but our spiritual outlook would be different. We would lay less stress on \'facts and figures\' and more on a good memory, on applied psychology, and on the capacity of a man to get along with his fellow-citizens. If our educational system were fashioned after its bookless past we would have the most democratic form of \'college\' imaginable.

It has yet to reach its full size and strength, and its owner his or her full intelligence; but at this age the likelihood of death is least. Earlier, we were infants and young children, and consequently more vulnerable; later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance which, though imperceptible at first, will finally become so steep that we can live no longer, however well we look after ourselves, and however well society, and our doctors, look after us. This decline in vigour with the passing of time is called ageing. It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make that we must decline in this way, that if we escape wars, accidents and diseases we shall eventually \'die of old age\', and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, so that there are heavy odds in favour of our dying between the ages of 65 and 80. Some of us will die sooner, a few will live longer -- on into a ninth or tenth decade.

They have a character, perhaps two; they are in that condition of eager discomfort which passes for inspiration; all admit radical changes of destination once the journey has begun; one, to my certain knowledge, spent nine months on a novel about Kashmir, then reset the whole thing in the Scottish Highlands. I never heard of anyone making a \'skeleton\', as we were taught at school. In the breaking and remaking, in the timing, interweaving, beginning afresh, the writer comes to discern things in his material which were not consciously in his mind when he began. This organic process, often leading to moments of extraordinary self-discovery, is of an indescribable fascination. A blurred image appears; he adds a brushstroke and another, and it is gone; but something was there, and he will not rest till he has captured it. Sometimes the yeast within a writer outlives a book he has written. I have heard of writers who read nothing but their own books; like adolescents they stand before the mirror, and still cannot fathom the exact outline of the vision before them. For the same reason, writers talk interminably about their own books, winkling out hidden meanings, super-imposing new ones, begging response from those around them. Of course a writer doing this is misunderstood: he might as well try to explain a crime or a love affair. He is also, incidentally, an unforgivable bore.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-39-What-every-writer-wants-\u4f5c\u5bb6\u4e4b\u6240\u9700.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-39-What-every-writer-wants-\u4f5c\u5bb6\u4e4b\u6240\u9700","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-39-What-every-writer-wants-\u4f5c\u5bb6\u4e4b\u6240\u9700","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-39-What-every-writer-wants-\u4f5c\u5bb6\u4e4b\u6240\u9700.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 39 Nothing to worry about \u4e0d\u5fc5\u62c5\u5fc3","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-39-Nothing-to-worry-about-\u4e0d\u5fc5\u62c5\u5fc3"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 4 Seeing hands  \u80fd\u770b\u89c1\u4e1c\u897f\u7684\u624b","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-4-Seeing-hands--\u80fd\u770b\u89c1\u4e1c\u897f\u7684\u624b"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-4-Seeing-hands--\u80fd\u770b\u89c1\u4e1c\u897f\u7684\u624b","title":"Lesson 4 Seeing hands  \u80fd\u770b\u89c1\u4e1c\u897f\u7684\u624b","description":"Several cases have been reported in Russia recently of people who can read and detect colours with their fingers, and even see through solid doors and walls.

City born and city bred, I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasionally visit during the weekend. Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of them has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months. Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life. He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gentle pace of living. Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture. My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV ---- virtually the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-41-Illusions-of-pastoral-peace-\u5b81\u9759\u7530\u56ed\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u9050\u60f3.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-41-Illusions-of-pastoral-peace-\u5b81\u9759\u7530\u56ed\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u9050\u60f3","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-41-Illusions-of-pastoral-peace-\u5b81\u9759\u7530\u56ed\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u9050\u60f3","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-41-Illusions-of-pastoral-peace-\u5b81\u9759\u7530\u56ed\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u9050\u60f3.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 40 Who\'s who \u771f\u5047\u96be\u8fa8","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-40-Who\'s-who-\u771f\u5047\u96be\u8fa8"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 41 Training elephants \u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8c61","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-41-Training-elephants-\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8c61"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-41-Training-elephants-\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8c61","title":"Lesson 41 Training elephants \u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8c61","description":"Two main techniques have been used for training elephants, which we may call respectively the tough and the gentle.

But other suns, stars as the astronomers call them, are bound to have planets like our own, and as is the number of stars in the universe is so vast, this possibility becomes virtual certainty.

At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper, you spend half the night staring at the small almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic. By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food----always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm.

Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework. She had a huge, rambling country house called\u2018The Gables\u2019. She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband\'s death. Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entertain lavishly. I often visited The Gables when I was a boy. No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate. The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass cabinets; even my uncle\'s huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust. Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished. She always referred to them as\u2018the shifting population\u2019, for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names. Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy, in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please. While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-49-The-ideal-servant-\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4ec6\u4eba.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-49-The-ideal-servant-\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4ec6\u4eba","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-49-The-ideal-servant-\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4ec6\u4eba","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-49-The-ideal-servant-\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u4ec6\u4eba.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 48 The silent village \u6c89\u9ed8\u7684\u6751\u5e84","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-48-The-silent-village-\u6c89\u9ed8\u7684\u6751\u5e84"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 5 The facts \u786e\u5207\u6570\u5b57","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-5-The-facts-\u786e\u5207\u6570\u5b57"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-5-The-facts-\u786e\u5207\u6570\u5b57","title":"Lesson 5 The facts \u786e\u5207\u6570\u5b57","description":"Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics.

Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of\u2018dos\u2019and\u2018don\'ts\u2019. The same old favourites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don\'t like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening. An all-night party on New Year\'s Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying on either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-50-New-Year-resolutions-\u65b0\u5e74\u7684\u51b3\u5fc3.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-50-New-Year-resolutions-\u65b0\u5e74\u7684\u51b3\u5fc3","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-50-New-Year-resolutions-\u65b0\u5e74\u7684\u51b3\u5fc3","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-50-New-Year-resolutions-\u65b0\u5e74\u7684\u51b3\u5fc3.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 5 Youth \u9752\u5e74","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-5-Youth-\u9752\u5e74"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 51 Predicting the future \u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-51-Predicting-the-future-\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-51-Predicting-the-future-\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765","title":"Lesson 51 Predicting the future \u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765","description":"Predicting the future is notoriously difficult.

We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good. We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat against our lighted windows. We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless ones like moths. Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. No matter how much we like honey, or howmuch we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that; like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence.

Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full of associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-59-Collecting-\u6536\u85cf.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-59-Collecting-\u6536\u85cf","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-59-Collecting-\u6536\u85cf","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-59-Collecting-\u6536\u85cf.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lessons 58 A spot of bother \u4e00\u70b9\u513f\u5c0f\u9ebb\u70e6","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-58-A-spot-of-bother-\u4e00\u70b9\u513f\u5c0f\u9ebb\u70e6"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab \u7838\u6a71\u7a97\u62a2\u52ab","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-6-Smash-and-grab-\u7838\u6a71\u7a97\u62a2\u52ab"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-6-Smash-and-grab-\u7838\u6a71\u7a97\u62a2\u52ab","title":"Lesson 6 Smash-and-grab \u7838\u6a71\u7a97\u62a2\u52ab","description":"The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening.

Without it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion; everything would be in a state of chaos. Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. The intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. But people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, so they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. If no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tyres, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. They are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. Some friends of my family had this irritating habit. The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. Then they arrived just when we wanted them.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-60-Too-early-and-too-late-\u592a\u65e9\u548c\u592a\u665a.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-60-Too-early-and-too-late-\u592a\u65e9\u548c\u592a\u665a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-60-Too-early-and-too-late-\u592a\u65e9\u548c\u592a\u665a","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-60-Too-early-and-too-late-\u592a\u65e9\u548c\u592a\u665a.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 6 The sporting spirit \u4f53\u80b2\u7684\u7cbe\u795e","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-6-The-sporting-spirit-\u4f53\u80b2\u7684\u7cbe\u795e"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 7 Bats \u8759\u8760","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Bats-\u8759\u8760"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Bats-\u8759\u8760","title":"Lesson 7 Bats \u8759\u8760","description":"Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.","source":"@site/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Bats-\u8759\u8760.md","sourceDirName":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed","slug":"/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Bats-\u8759\u8760","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Bats-\u8759\u8760","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/hyaliyun/English/edit/main/website/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Bats-\u8759\u8760.md","tags":[],"version":"current","frontMatter":{},"sidebar":"devDocsSidebar","previous":{"title":"Lesson 60 Too early and too late \u592a\u65e9\u548c\u592a\u665a","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-60-Too-early-and-too-late-\u592a\u65e9\u548c\u592a\u665a"},"next":{"title":"Lesson 7 Mutilated ladies \u6b8b\u949e\u9274\u522b\u7ec4","permalink":"/google/\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Mutilated-ladies-\u6b8b\u949e\u9274\u522b\u7ec4"}},{"id":"\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u82f1\u8bed/Lesson-7-Mutilated-ladies-\u6b8b\u949e\u9274\u522b\u7ec4","title":"Lesson 7 Mutilated ladies \u6b8b\u949e\u9274\u522b\u7ec4","description":"Has it ever happened to you?

They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses.
