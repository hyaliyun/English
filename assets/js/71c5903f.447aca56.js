It seems as if those personal averages are almost always used to measure where we are in comparison to our peers."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And I think we should look at that a little differently. That personal average is just that, it's something very personal and it's for you, and I think if you focus on that and work to build that, you can really start to accomplish some really amazing things."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This idea started for me on a December evening in 2011. I has just stepped outside to do our evening chores to feed our horses.

And I said,"Yes." And there was a brief pause and then I heard her yell, "Do you need 911 help?" And again I yelled, "Yes." Well, not long after I was enjoying my very first helicopter ride, all the way to the hospital.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, the injury wasn't very dramatic or graphic.

It took some very consistent prodding from my wife, who kept saying, "Get your eyes up," before I could get moving forward.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And I soon realized that almost had to forget about the person I was before and the things I was able to do before.

Neither had I. And so what do you do? You try to do what you did a couple of years ago, and you do a couple of sets. And then what do you do? A couple more. And you're feeling even better, so you do more. And the next two weeks you complain to your family about how sore you are."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Well, my team went all out and we won, we won big, and for the next three days I could not straighten my arms, which isn't that big a deal except when you're in a wheelchair, and that's really what you have to use to get around."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And that proved to be a very important lesson for me. It was one thing that I couldn't compare myself to myself, but even around people in the same situation in that hospital, I found that I couldn't try to keep pace or set pace with them as well, and I was left with really only one choice and that was to focus on who I was at that point in time, with where I needed to go and to get back to who I needed to be."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For the next six weeks, for seven to eight hours a day, that's what I did.

There were parts of my day that certainly not as pleasant as they could be, but it was never an entirely bad day."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So I'm guessing that all of you have been through a meeting that probably didn't go very well, or a commute that wasn't as great as you would like it, or even burned dinner at night. Did those things really ruin your entire day?"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What I found in those scenarios is the quicker you move on to what's next, the quicker you can start attacking things. And by moving on to next as fast as possible, you shrink the time you spend in those bad scenarios, and it gives more time for the good. And, as a result, the good outweight the bad, your average increases and that's just how the math works."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It didn't matter to me if I'd spent the morning really struggling with my medication, or at lunch my legs being very spastic, or even if I had fallen out of my wheelchair.

They were just small parts of my day and small parts of my average."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And so, in the months and years that followed, I continued to try to attack things in that way, and before I knew it I was being presented with some pretty incredible challenges, like completing a marathon in a wheelchair."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'In early 2016, I met my physical therapist, and after a few really grueling sessions, she must have sensed something, because she pulled me aside and said, "You know, you should do a half marathon. In your wheelchair. And, oh yeah, it\'s in 10 weeks."'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And I thought in my mind, \"You're crazy.\" I didn't have a workout plan. I didn't have any way of knowing how fast I needed to go, or how far I was supposed to go. But I simply got to work, and I started tracking every workout, every day, and I simply wanted to be as good as or as fast as I was the prior day."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And in the end I really created that average for myself, and I tried to build on that as much as I could."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Well, I finished that race right in time with what my average should have been, and somewhere along the way, I kind of closed the door on who I once was. That person who I was before, and all those things I thought I was able to do really didn't matter. In fact. walking again really didn't matter."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It became much less of a goal for me in terms of where I was going to go. And besides, like, you guys are so slow when you walk. In crowds like this, it is so difficult. I'm like, \"Get out of the way, We're going places.\""}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And all I wanted to do was go fast. So I did what I thought I should do. I started researching wheelchair racing.

You're dumped off, there's a whole bunch of people around you, you don't really know very many of them, somebody's got the cool stereo and the cool TV, and they're smart and they're pretty and they're cute and they're handsome, and you don't know if you really belong."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'But then somebody says, "Hey, let\'s go get food."

And wouldn't you know it, all of the people that I had been researching were there, the best in the world."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There must have been over 50 Paralympic medals in the room that day.

I went home, and I got busy."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now, as you can imagine, being in a wheelchair, let alone training for a marathon in a wheelchair, is a pretty lonely thing. I have an incredible group of friends that will ride bikes with me and keep track of pace and help me out. But in the end, it's still five to six days a week, it's 50 to 60 miles of effort, and it's a lot of alone time."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And for the most part, you really have nothing to rely on but yourself in those times. It's my average, and I'm trying to get better little by little. Well, this fall I was in Chicago for the third time. It was my seventh marathon, and just like going back to college for your junior year, you're anticipating catching up with friends, and getting excited about rolling right back into things."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Well, I attended the same pre-race meeting and the same pre-race meal, and caught up with those friends. And we lined up for race, and right at the start, my average kicked in, and before long I caught up with some of those friends, and was able to keep pace with them and push together. But it wasn't long before I faded."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It just happened, and I found myself all alone again, with really nothing to rely on other than what I had worked so hard to be at.

This is my average. Seventy-five days from today, I'll be in Bostom for my second time. I'm super excited about that. But keep in mind, this isn't really just about racing.
