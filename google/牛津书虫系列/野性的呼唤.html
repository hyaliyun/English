<p>Buck did not read the newspapers  He did not know that trouble was coming for every big dog in California  Men had found gold in the Yukon  and these men wanted big  strong dogs to work in the cold and snow of the north</p>
<p>Buck lived in Mr Miller&#x27;s big house in the sunny Santa Clara valley There were large gardens and fields of fruit trees around the house  and a river nearby  In a big place like this of course  there were many dogs There were house dogs and farm dogs  but they were not important Buck was chief dog he was born here  and this was his place  He was four years old and weighed sixty kilos  He went swimming with Mr Miller&#x27;s sons and walking with his daughters  He carried the grandchildren on his back  and he sat at Mr Miller&#x27;s feet in front of the fire in winter</p>
<p>But this was 1897  and Buck did not know that men and dogs were hurrying to north-west Canada to look for gold And he did not know that Manuel  one of Mr Miller&#x27;s garden ers  needed money for his large family  One day when Mr Miller was out  Manuel and Buck left the garden together It was just an evening walk  Buck thought No one saw them go  and only one man saw them arrive at the railway station This man talked to Manuel  and gave him some money  Then he tied a piece of rope around Buck&#x27;s neck</p>
<p>Buck growled  and was surprised when the rope was pulled hard around his neck He jumped at the man The man caught him and suddenly Buck was on his back with his tongue out of his mouth  For a few moments he was unable to move  and it was easy for the two men to put him into the train</p>
<p>When Buck woke up  the train was still moving  The man was sitting and watching him  but Buck was too quick for him and he bit the man&#x27;s hand hard Then the rope was pulled again and Buck had to let go</p>
<p>That evening  the man took Buck to the back room of a bar in San Francisco  The barman looked at the man&#x27;s hand and trousers covered in blood</p>
<p>How much are they paying you for this  he asked</p>
<p>I only get fifty dollars</p>
<p>And the man who stole him how much did he get   asked the barman</p>
<p>A hundred  He wouldn&#x27;t take less</p>
<p>That makes a hundred and fifty  It&#x27;s a good price for a dog like him  Here  help me to get him into this</p>
<p>They took off Buck&#x27;s rope and pushed him into a wooden box  He spent the night in the box in the back room of the bar  His neck still ached with pain from the rope  and he could not understand what it all meant   What did they want with him  these strange men  And where was Mr Miller</p>
<p>The next day Buck was carried in the box to the railway station and put on a train</p>
<p>to the north</p>
<p>For two days and nights the train travelled north  and for two days and nights Buck neither ate nor drank  Men on the train laughed at him and pushed sticks at him through the holes in the box  For two days and nights Buck got angrier and hungrier and thirsti-er  His eyes grew red and he bit anything that moved</p>
<p>In Seattle four men took Buck to a small  high walled back garden  where a fat man in an old red coat was waiting  Buck was now very angry indeed and hejumped and bit at the sides of his box  The fat man smiled and went to get an axe and a club</p>
<p>Are you going to take him out now   asked one of the men   Of course   answered the fat man  and he began to break the box with his axe</p>
<p>Immediately the four other men climbed up onto the wall to watch from a safe place</p>
<p>As the fat man hit the box with his axe  Buck jumped at the sides  growling and biting  pulling with his teeth at the pieces of broken wood  After a few minutes there was a hole big enough for Buck to get out    Now  come here  red eyes   said the fat man  dropping his axe and taking the club in his right hand</p>
<p>Buck jumped at the man  sixty kilos of anger  his mouth wide open ready to bite the man&#x27;s neck  Just before his teeth touched the skin  the man hit him with the club  Buck fell to the ground  It was the first time anyone had hit him with a club and he did not understand  He stood up  and jumped again  Again the club hit him and he crashed to the ground Ten times he jumped at the man  and ten times the club hit him  Slowly he got to his feet  now only just able to stand There was blood on his nose and mouth and ears  Then the fat man walked up and hit him again  very hard  on the nose The pain was terrible  Again  Buck jumped at the man and again he was hit to the ground A last time he jumped  and this time  when the man knocked him down  Buck did not move</p>
<p>He knows how to teach a dog a lesson   said one of the men on the wall  Then the four men jumped down and went back to the station</p>
<p>His name is Buck  said the fat man to himself  reading the letter that had come with the box  Well  Buck  my by  he said in a friendly voice  we&#x27;ve argued a little  and I think the best thing to do now is to stop  Be a good dog and we&#x27;ll be friends  But if you&#x27;re a bad dog  I&#x27;ll have to use my club again Understand</p>
<p>As he spoke  he touched Buck  s head  and although Buck was angry inside  he did not move  When the man brought him water and meat  Buck drank and then ate the meat  piece by piece  from the man&#x27;s hand</p>
<p>Buck was beaten he knew that  but he was not broken  He had learnt that a man with a club was stronger than him Every day he saw more dogs arrive  and each dog was beaten by the fat man  Buck understood that a man with a club must be obeyed  although he did not have to be a friend</p>
<p>Men came to see the fat man and to look at the dogs  Some-times they paid money and left with one or more of the dogs One day a short  dark man came and looked at Buck</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a good dog   he cried  How much do you want for him</p>
<p>Three hundred dollars  It&#x27;s a good price  Perrault  said the fat man</p>
<p>Perrault smiled and agreed that it was a good price  He knew dogs  and he knew that Buck was an excellent dog</p>
<p>One in ten thousand   Perrault said to himself</p>
<p>Buck saw money put into the fat man  s hand  and he was not surprised when he and another dog called Curly were taken away by Perrault  He took them to a ship  and later that day Buck and Curly stood and watched the coast get further and further away They had seen the warm south for the last time</p>
<p>Perrault took Buck and Curly down to the bottom of the ship  There they met another man  Francois  Perrault was a French Canadian  but Francois was half Indian tall and dark Buck learnt quickly that Perrault and Francois were fair men calm and honest  And they knew everything about dogs</p>
<p>There were two other dogs on the ship One was a big dog called Spitz  as white as snow  He was friendly to Buck at first  always smiling  He was smiling when he tried to steal Buck  s food at the first meal  Francois was quick and hit Spitz before Buck had time to move  Buck decided that this was fair  and began to like Francois a little</p>
<p>Dave  the other dog  was not friendly  He wanted to be alone all the time  He ate and slept and was interested in nothing</p>
<p>One day was very like another  but Buck noticed that the weather was getting colder  One morning  the ship&#x27;s engines stopped  and there was a feeling of excitement in the ship Francois leashed the dogs and took them outside  At the first step Buck&#x27;s feet went into something soft and white  He jumped back in surprise  The soft  white thing was also falling through the air  and it fell onto him  He tried to smell it  and then caught some on his tongue  It bit like fire  and then dis appeared  He tried again and the same thing happened  People were watching him and laughing  and Buck felt ashamed although he did not know why  It was his first snow</p>
<p>2  The law of club and tooth</p>
<p>Buck&#x27;s first day at Dyea Beach was terrible  Every hour there was some new  frightening surprise  There was no peace  no rest only continual noise and movement  And every minute there was danger  because these dogs and men were not town dogs and men  They knew only the law of club and tooth</p>
<p>Buck had never seen dogs fight like these dogs  they were like wolves  In a few minutes he learnt this from watching Curly  She tried to make friends with a dog  a big one  al though not as big as she was  There was no warning  The dog jumped on Curly  his teeth closed together  then he jumped away and Curly&#x27;s face was torn open from eye to mouth</p>
<p>Wolves fight like this biting and jumping away but the fight did not finish then  Thirty or forty more dogs ran up and made a circle around the fight  watching silently  Curly tried to attack the dog who had bitten her  he bit her a second time  and jumped away  When she attacked him again  he knocked her backwards  and she fell on the ground  She never stood up again  because this was what the other dogs were waiting for  They moved in  and in a moment she was under a crowd of dogs</p>
<p>It was all very sudden  Buck saw Spitz run out from the crowd with his tongue out of his mouth  laughing  Then he saw Francois with an axe  and two or three other men with clubs jump in among the dogs  Two minutes later the last of the dogs was chased away  But Curly lay dead in the snow her body torn almost to pieces Curly&#x27;s death often came backto Buck in his dreams  He understood that once a dog was down on the ground  he was dead He also remembered Spitz laughing  and from that moment he hated him</p>
<p>Then Buck had another surprise  Francois put a harness on him  Buck had seen harnesses on horses  and now he was made to work like a horse  pulling Francois on a sledge into the forest and returning with wood for the fire  Buck worked with Spitz and Dave The two other dogs had worked in a har ness before  and Buck learnt by watching them  He also learnt to stop and turn when Francois shouted</p>
<p>Those three are very good dogs  Francois told Perrault  That Buck pulls very well  and he&#x27;s learning quickly</p>
<p>Perrault had important letters and official papers to take to Dawson City  so that afternoon he bought two more dogs  two brothers called Billee and Joe Billee was very friendly  but Joe was the opposite  In the evening Perrault bought one more dog  an old dog with one eye  His name was Sol-leks  which means The Angry One  Like Dave  he made no friends  all he wanted was to be alone</p>
<p>That night Buck discovered another problem  Where was he going to sleep Francois and Perrault were in their tent  but when he went in  they shouted angrily and threw things at him Outside it was very cold and windy  He lay down in the snow  but he was too cold to sleep</p>
<p>He walked around the tents trying to find the other dogs But  to his surprise  they had disappeared  He walked around Perrault&#x27;s tent very  very cold  wondering what to do  Sud-denly  the snow under his feet fell in  and he felt something move  He jumped back  waiting for the attack  but heard on-ly a friendly bark  There  in a warm hole under the snow was Billee</p>
<p>So that was what you had to do  Buck chose a place  dug himself a hole and in a minute he was warm and asleep  He slept well  although his dreams were bad</p>
<p>When he woke up  at first he did not know where he was It had snowed in the night and the snow now lay thick and heavy above him  Suddenly he was afraid the fear of a wild animal when it is caught and cannot escape  Growling  he threw himself at the snow  and a moment later  he had jumped upwards into the daylight  He saw the tents and re membered everything  from the time he had gone for a walk with Manuel to the moment he had dug the hole the night before   What did I say   shouted Francois to Perrault  when he saw Buck come up out of the snow  That Buck learns quickly</p>
<p>Perrault smiled slowly  He was carrying important papers and he needed good dogs  He was very pleased to have Buck</p>
<p>They bought three more dogs that morning  and a quarter of an hour later all nine dogs were in harness and on their way up the Dyea Canyon  Buck was not sorry to be moving  and although it was hard work  he almost enjoyed it  He was also surprised to see that Dave and Sol leks no longer looked bored and miserable Pulling in a harness was their job  and they were happy to do it</p>
<p>Dave was sledge dog  the dog nearest to the sledge In front of him was Buck  then came Sol-leks  In front of them were the six other dogs  with Spitz as leader at the front  Francois had put Buck between Dave and Sol leks because they could teach him the work Buck learnt well and they were good teachers  When Buck pulled the wrong way  Dave always bit his leg  but only lightly  Once  when they stopped  Buck got tied up in his harness  and it took ten minutes to get started again Both Dave and Sol leks gave him a good beating for that mistake  Buck understood  and was more careful after that</p>
<p>It was a hard day&#x27;s journey  up the Dyea Canyon and into the mountains  They camped that night at Lake Bennett Here there were thousands of gold miners They were building boats to sail up the lake when the ice melted in the spring Buck made his hole in the snow and slept well  but was woken up very early and harnessed to the sledge  The first day they had travelled on snow that had been hardened by many sledges and they covered sixty kilometres  But the next day  and for days afterwards  they were on new snow  The work was harder and they went slowly  Usually  Perrault went in front on snowshoes  flattening the snow a little for the dogs Francois stayed by the sledge  Sometimes the two men changed places  but there were many small lakes and rivers and Perrault understood ice better  He always knew when the ice across a river was very thin</p>
<p>Day after day Buck pulled in his harness They started in the morning before it was light  and they stopped in the evening after dark  ate a piece of fish  and went to sleep in their holes under the snow  Buck was always hungry  Francoisgave him 750 grams of dried fish a day  and it was never enough  The other dogs were given only 500 grams  they were smaller and could stay dive on less food</p>
<p>Buck learnt to eat quickly  if he was too slow  the other dogs stole his food  He saw Pike  one of the new dogs  steal some meat from the sledge when Perrault wasn&#x27;t looking The next day Buck stole some and got away unseen  Perrault was very angry  but he thought another dog  Dub  had taken it and so punished him instead of Buck</p>
<p>Buck was learning how to live in the north  In the south he had never stolen  but there he had never been so hungry  He stole cleverly and secretly  remembering the beatings from the man with the club</p>
<p>Buck was learning the law of club and tooth</p>
<p>He learnt to eat any food anything that he could get his teeth into  He learnt to break the ice on water holes with his feet when he wanted to drink He was stronger  harder  and could see and smell better than ever before  In a way he was remembering back to the days when wild dogs travelled in packs through the forest  killing for meat as they went It was easy for him to learn to fight like a wolf  because it was in his blood  In the evenings  when he pointed his nose at the moon and howled long and loud  he was remembering the dogs and wolves that had come before him</p>
<p>3  The wild animal</p>
<p>The wild animal was strong in Buck  and as he travelled across the snow  it grew stronger and stronger  And as Buck grew stronger  he hated Spitz more and more  although he was careful never to start a fight</p>
<p>But Spitz was always showing his teeth to Buck  trying to start a fight  And Buck knew that if he and Spitz fought  one of them would die</p>
<p>The fight almost happened one night when they stopped by Lake Laberge There was heavy snow and it was very cold The lake was frozen and Francois  Perrault  and the dogs had to spend the night on the ice  under a big rock  Buck had made a warm hole in the snow and was sorry to leave it to get his piece of fish  But when he had eaten  and returned to his hole  he found Spitz in it  Buck had tried not to fight Spitz be fore  but this was too much  He attacked him angrily  Spitz was surprised  He knew Buck was big  but he didn  t know he was so wild  Francois was surprised too  and guessed why Buck was angry   Go on Buck   he shouted  Fight him  the dirty thief</p>
<p>Spitz was also ready to fight  and the two dogs circled one another  looking for the chance to jump in  But suddenly there was a shout from Perrault  and they saw eighty or a hundred dogs around the sledge  The dogs came from an Indian village and they were searching for the food that they could smell on the sledge  Perrault and Francois tried to fight them off with their clubs  but the dogs  made crazy by the smell of the food showed their teeth and fought back</p>
<p>Buck had never seed dogs like these  They were all skin and bone  but hunger made them fight like wild things Three of them attacked Buck and in seconds his head and legs were bad ly bitten Dave and Sol-leks stood side by side covered in blood fighting bravely  Joe and Pike jumped on one dog and Pike broke its neck with one bite Buck caught another dog by the neck and tasted blood  He threw himself on the next one and then felt teeth in his own neck It was Spitz attacking him from the side</p>
<p>Perrault and Francois came to help with clubs  but then they had to run back to save the food   It was safer for the nine sledge dogs to run away across the lake  Several of them were badly hurt  and they spent an unhappy night hiding among the tress</p>
<p>At first light they returned to the sledge and found Perrault and Francois tired and angry Half their food was gone The Indian dogs had even eaten one of Perrault&#x27;s shoes Francois looked at his dogs unhappily</p>
<p>Ah  my friends  he said softly  Perhaps those bites will make you ill What do you think  Perrault</p>
<p>Perrault said nothing  They still had six hundred kilometres to travel  and he hoped very much that his sledge dogs had not caught rabies from the Indian dogs</p>
<p>The harness was torn and damaged and it was two hours be fore they were moving  travelling slowly and painfully over the most difficult country that they had been in</p>
<p>The Thirty Mile River was not frozen  It ran too fast to freeze  They spent six days trying to find a place to cross  and every step was dangerous for dogs and men  Twelve times they found ice bridges across the river  and Perrault walked carefully onto them  holding a long piece of wood  And twelve times he fell through a bridge and was saved by the piece of wood  which caught on the sides of the hole But the tempera-ture was 45  below zero  and each time Perrault fell into the water  he had to light a fire to dry and warm himself  Once the sledge fell through the ice  with Dave and Buck  and they were covered in ice by the time Perrault and Francois pulled them out of the river Again  a fire was needed to save them Another time  Spitz and the dogs in front fell through the ice Buck and Dave and Francois at the sledge had to pull backwards That day they travelled only four hundred metres</p>
<p>When they got to the Hootalinqua and good ice  Buck and the other dogs were very  very tired  But they were late  so Perrault made them run faster  In three days they went a hun dred and eighty kilometres and reached the Five Fingers</p>
<p>The other dogs had hard feet from years of pulling sledges but Buck&#x27;s feet were still soft from his easy life down south All day he ran painfully  and when they camped for the night he lay down like a dead dog He was hungry but he was too tired to walk to the fish  so Francois brought it to him One day Francois made four little shoes for him  and this made Buck much more comfortable  Francois forgot the shoes one morning  and Buck refused to move  He lay on his back with his feet in the air  until Francois put the shoes on  Later his feet grew harder and the shoes were not needed</p>
<p>One morning  at the Pelly River  a dog called Delly went suddenly mad  She howled long and loud like a wolf and then jumped at Buck  Buck ran  with Dolly one step behind him She could not catch him  but he could not escape from her They ran half a kilometre  and then Buck heard Francois call to him  He turned and ran towards the man  sure that Francois would save him  Francois stood  holding his axe and as Buck passed  the axe crashed down on Dolly&#x27;s head</p>
<p>Buck fell down by the sledge  too tired to move  Immedi-ately  Spitz attacked him and bit his helpless enemy twice  as hard as he could  But Francois saw this  and gave Spitz a ter rible beating for it</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a wild dog  that Spitz  said Perrault  One day he&#x27;ll kill Buck</p>
<p>Buck is wilder  replied Francois  I&#x27;ve been watching him  One day he&#x27;ll get very angry and he&#x27;ll fight Spitz  and he&#x27;ll win   Francois was right  Buck wanted to be lead-dog Spitz knew this and hated him  Buck started to help the other dogs when Spitz punished them for being lazy One morning  Pike refused to get up  and Spitz looked for him everywhere  When he found him  he jumped at him But suddenly  Buck at tacked Spitz  The other dogs saw this  and it became more and more difficult for Spitz to lead them But the days passed without a chance for a fight  and soon they were pulling into Dawson City on a cold grey afternoon</p>
<p>They stayed in Dawson for seven days  When they left Perrault was carrying some more very important papers  and he wanted to travel back as fast as possible</p>
<p>They travelled eighty kilometres the first day  and the same the second  But it was difficult work for Francois  Buck and Spitz hated each other  and the other dogs were not afraid of Spitz any more  One night Pike stole half a fish from Spitz and ate it standing next to Buck  And every time Buck went near Spitz  he growled and the hair on his back stood up angri-ly  The other dogs fought in their harnesses and Francois often had to stop the sledge He knew that Buck was the problem but Buck was too clever for him and Francois never saw him actually starting a fight</p>
<p>One night in camp  the dogs saw a snow rabbit and in a sec-ond they were all chasing it  with Spitz in front  Nearby was another camp  with fifty dogs  who also Joined the chase  The rabbit was running fast on top of the snow  but the snow was soft  and it was more difficult for the dogs  When Spitz caught the rabbit  throwing it in the air with his teeth  Buck was just behind  Spitz stopped  and Buck hit him  very hard  The two dogs fell in the snow  Spitz bit Buck very quickly  twice  and then jumped away  watching carefully</p>
<p>The time had come  and Buck knew that either he or Spitz must die  They watched one another  circling slowly  Themoon was shining brightly on the snow  and in the cold still air not a leaf moved on the trees  The other dogs finished eating the rabbit and then turned to watch</p>
<p>Spitz was a good fighter  He was full of hate and anger  but he was also intelligent  Every time Buck tried to bite his throat  he met Spitz&#x27;s own teeth  Then  each time Buck attacked  Spitz moved and bit him on the side as he passed After a few minutes Buck was covered in blood</p>
<p>He attacked again  but this time turned at the last minute and went under Spitz  biting his left front leg  The bone broke  and Spitz was standing on three legs  Buck tried to knock Spitz down  and then repeated his earlier attack and broke Spitz&#x27;s right front leg</p>
<p>There was no hope for Spitz now  Buck got ready for his final attack  while the circle of sixty dogs watched  and crowded nearer and nearer  waiting for the end  At last Buck jumped  in and out  and Spitz went down in the snow  A second later the waiting pack was on top of him  and Spitz had disappeared  Buck stood and watched  The wild animal had made its kill</p>
<p>4  The new lead-dog</p>
<p>Well  what did I say  Buck  s a real fighter all right   said Francois the next morning when he discovered that Spitz had disappeared and that Buck was covered in blood</p>
<p>Spitz fought like a wolf  said Perrault  as he looked at the bites all over Buck</p>
<p>And Buck fought like ten wolves   answered Francois  And we&#x27;ll travel faster now  No more Spitz  no more trouble</p>
<p>Francois started to harness the dogs  He needed a new lead dog  and decided that Sol-leks was the best dog that he had But Buck jumped at Sol leks and took his place</p>
<p>Look at Buck   said Francois  laughing  He&#x27;s killed Spitz  and now he wants to be lead dog  Go away  Buck</p>
<p>He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Sol leks again Sol-leks was unhappy too  He was frightened of Buck  and when Francois turned his back  Buck took Sol-leks  place again  Now Francois was angry</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll show you   he cried  and went to get a heavy club from the sledge</p>
<p>Buck remembered the man in the red coat  and moved away  This time  when Sol-leks was harnessed as lead-dog Buck did not try to move in  He kept a few metres away and circled around Francois carefully  But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave  Buck refused  He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead dog</p>
<p>For an hour the two men tried to harness him  Buck did not run away  but he did not let them catch him  Finally Francois sat down  and Perrault looked at his watch It was getting late The two men looked at one another and smiled Francois walked up to Sol-leks  took off his harness  led him back and harnessed him in his old place Then he called Buck All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front But Buck did not move</p>
<p>Put down the club   said Perrault</p>
<p>Francois dropped the club  and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team Francois harnessed him  and in a minute the sledge was moving</p>
<p>Buck was an excellent leader  He moved and thought quick ly and led the other dogs well  A new leader made no differ ence to Dave and Sol-leks  they continued to pull hard  But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes Pike  the second dog was usually lazy  but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life  The first night in camp Buck fought Joe  another difficult dog  and after that there were no more problems with him  The team started to pull together  and to move faster and faster</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a dog like Buck  cried Francois  Never He&#x27;s worth a thousand dollars  What do you think Perrault</p>
<p>Perrault agreed They were moving quickly  and covering more ground every day The snow was good and hard  and no new snow fell The temperature dropped to 45  below zero and didn&#x27;t change</p>
<p>This time there was more ice on the Thirty Mile River  and they crossed in a day Some days they ran a hundred kilome tres  or even more They reached Skagway in fourteen days the fastest time ever</p>
<p>For three days the dogs rested in Skagway Then Francois put his arms around Buck&#x27;s neck and said goodbye to him And that was the last of Francois and Perrault  Like other men  they passed out of Buck&#x27;s life for ever</p>
<p>Two new men took Buck and his team back north on the long journey to Dawson travelling with several other dog teams  It was heavy work  the sledge was loaded with letters for the gold miners of Dawson  Buck did not like it  but he worked hard  and made the other dogs work hard  too  Each day was the same  They started early  before it was light  and at night they stopped and camped and the dogs ate For the dogs this was the best part of the day  first eating  then resting by the fire</p>
<p>Buck liked to lie by the fire  looking at the burning wood Sometimes he thought about Mr Miller&#x27;s house in California More of ten he remembered the man in the red coat and his club  the death of Curly  the fight with Spitz  and the good things that he had eaten But sometimes he remembered other things These were things that he remembered through his parents  and his parents parents  and all the dogs which had lived before him</p>
<p>Sometimes as he lay there  he seemed to see  in a waking dream  a different fire  And he saw next to him  not the Indian cook  but another man  a man with shorter legs  and longer arms  This man had long hair and deep eyes  and madestrange noises in his throat He was very frightened of the dark and looked around him all the time  holding a heavy stone in his hand  He wore the skin of an animal on his back and Buck could see thick hair all over his body</p>
<p>Buck sat by the fire with this hairy man  and in the circling darkness beyond the fire he could see many eyes the eyes of hungry animals waiting to attack  And he growled softly in his dream until the Indian cook shouted  Hey  Buck  wake up  Then the strange world disappeared and Buck&#x27;s eyes saw the real fire again</p>
<p>When they reached Dawson  the dogs were tired  and needed a week&#x27;s rest But in two days they were moving south again  with another heavy load of letters  Both dogs and men were unhappy  It snowed every day as well  and on soft new snow it was harder work pulling the sledges</p>
<p>The men took good care of their dogs In the evenings  the dogs ate first the men second and they always checked the dogs  feet before they slept  But every day the dogs became weaker Buck had pulled sledges for three thousand kilometres that winter  and he was as tired as the others</p>
<p>But Dave was not only tired  he was ill  Every evening he lay down the minute after the sledge stopped  and did not stand up until morning  The men looked at him  but they could find no broken bones  Something was wrong inside</p>
<p>One day he started to fall down while in his harness  The sledge stopped  and the driver took him out of his harness  He wanted to give him a rest  and let him run free behind the sledge  But Dave did not want to stop working  He hated to see another dog doing his work  so he ran along beside the sledge  trying to push Sol-leks out of his place  When the sledge made its next stop</p>
<p>Dave bit through Sol-leks  harness and pushed him away  Then he stood there  in his old place in front of the sledge  waiting for his harness and the order to start pulling</p>
<p>The driver decided it was kinder to let him work  Dave pulled all day  but the next morning he was too weak to move The driver harnessed up without Dave  and drove a few hun-dred metres  Then he stopped  took his gun  and walked back  The dogs heard a shot  and then the man came quickly back  The sledge started to move again  but Buck knew  and every dog knew  what had happened</p>
<p>5  More hard work</p>
<p>Thirty days after leaving Dawson City  the team arrived back in Skagway  They were very  very tired Buck now weighed only fifty kilograms  and the other dogs were also very thin</p>
<p>They were not ill  they just needed a long  long rest  But at Skagway there were mountains of letters waiting to go north so the men had to buy new  strong dogs The old ones  now useless for work  were sold</p>
<p>Two American men  called Hal and Charles  bought Buck and his team  together with the harness  Charles was forty years old  with light hair and watery blue eyes  Hal was a young man of twenty with a big shiny gun and a big knife in his belt  These things  more than anything  showed how young he was Both men were clearly new to the north  and its hard and dangerous life</p>
<p>They took the dogs back to their untidy camp  where a woman was waiting  This was Mercedes Charles&#x27;s wife and Hal&#x27;s sister</p>
<p>Buck watched the men take down the tent and load all their luggage on the sledge  They didn&#x27;t know how to do it sensibly  and every time they put something on the sledge Mercedes moved it  Often they had to take things off the sledge and start again</p>
<p>Three men came up and watched  laughing</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got a heavy load on that sledge   said one of them  Why don&#x27;t you leave the tent here in Skagway</p>
<p>How could we live without a tent   asked Mercedes throwing up her hands in the air</p>
<p>It&#x27;s spring now You won&#x27;t have any more cold weather</p>
<p>I must have a tent  she answered  and helped Charles and Hal with the last few boxes</p>
<p>Do you think that load will stay on  asked another man</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t it   asked Charles</p>
<p>Well  it&#x27;s a bit heavy on top  Do you think your dogs will be able to pull that</p>
<p>Of course they will  said Hal  The sledge was now ready to go   Come on dogs  pull   he shouted</p>
<p>The dogs pulled as hard as they could  but the sledge did not move</p>
<p>The lazy animals  shouted Hal  picking up his whip</p>
<p>But Mercedes stopped him  Oh  Hal  you mustn&#x27;t   she cried  pulling the whip away from him   The poor dogs You must promise to be nice to them or I&#x27;m staying here</p>
<p>You know nothing about dogs   answered Hal   Leave me alone Dogs are lazy  and you have to whip them  Everybody knows that  Ask those men if you don&#x27;t believe me</p>
<p>Mercedes turned and looked at the watching men</p>
<p>They  re tired  if you really want to know   said one of them  They  ve been working very hard and they need a rest</p>
<p>Rest  laughed Hal  These stupid dogs are just lazy</p>
<p>Now Mercedes decided that her brother was right  Don&#x27;t listen to that man  she said  You&#x27;re driving our dogs and you do what you think is best</p>
<p>Now Hal used his whip on the dogs. They pulled and pulled but the sledge stayed where it was Hal was still using his whip when Mercedes stopped him again and put her arms around Buck</p>
<p>You poor poor dears  she said  Why don&#x27;t you pull hard  then nobody will whip you</p>
<p>One of the men watching now spoke again  I don&#x27;t care what happens to you   he said  but I&#x27;m sorry for the dogs The sledge is frozen to the snow and you&#x27;ll have to break it out  Push it from one side to the other to break the ice</p>
<p>Hal tried again but this time he broke the ice under the sledge The heavy sledge started to move slowly Buck and his team pulling hard under the whip After a hundred metres they had to turn into another street It was a difficult turn with a top-heavy load and Hal was not a good driver As they turned the sledge went over onto its side throwing boxes and packets into the street The dogs didn&#x27;t stop  The sledge was not so heavy now and they pulled it easily on its side The whip had made them angry and they started to run Hal cried  Stop   but the dogs continued through Skagway and the rest of the luggage fell off as they ran</p>
<p>People helped to catch the dogs and to pick up all the things from the street  They also told the men that if they wanted to reach Dawson they needed twice as many dogs and half as much luggage Hal and Charles went back to the camp and started to look at the luggage and throw things away Tent blankets and plates were taken out Mercedes cried when most of her clothes went When they had finished Mercedes was still crying there was a lot of luggage on the road and there was still a lot to go on the sledge</p>
<p>Then Charles and Hal went out and bought six more dogs so they now had fourteen  But the new dogs were not real sledge dogs and they knew nothing about the work Charles and Hal put them into harness  but Buck could not teach them how to pull a sledge So now there were six dogs who couldn&#x27;t pull at all  and eight who were tired after pulling for four thousand kilometres But Charles and Hal were happy They had more dogs than any sledge that they had seen at Skagway They didn  t know that no sledge could carry enough food for fourteen dogs</p>
<p>The next morning Buck led the team up the street They moved slowly  because they were tired before they started Buck had pulled to Dawson and back twice and he didn&#x27;t want to do it again He had watched Hal and Charles and Mercedes and he saw that they didn&#x27;t know how to do any thing And as the days passed he saw that they could not learn It took them half the evening to get everything ready for the night and it took them half the morning to get ready to leave  And when they did start  they often had to stop because something had fallen off the sledge On some days they travelled twenty kilometres and on some days only ten</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t have enough dog food when they started and they used what they had much too quickly Hal gave the dogs extra food because he wanted them to pull harder Mercedes gave them extra food because she was sorry for them But it was not food that they wanted but rest</p>
<p>Soon Hal saw that they had travelled only a quarter of the way to Dawson but had eaten half their food He had to give the dogs less food  It was easy to give them less food but it was impossible to make them travel faster</p>
<p>Dub had pulled hard and well all the way from Skagway but he had hurt his leg It got worse and worse until finally Hal had to shoot him The six new dogs now weak and ill from hunger and hard work died next</p>
<p>Hal Charles and Mercedes had started the journey happily but now they were tired cross and miserable Charles and Hal argued about everything because each thought that he was working harder than the other And Mer cedes was unhappy because she thought that she shouldn&#x27;t have to work She was tired so she rode on the sledge mak ing the work even harder for the dogs She rode for days until the dogs could not move the sledge The men asked her to walk but she would not leave the sledge One day they lifted her off She sat in the snow and did not move They went off with the sledge and travelled five kilometres Then they turned went back and lifted her on again</p>
<p>Buck and the other dogs were now just skin and bone They pulled when they could and when they couldn&#x27;t they lay down in the snow When they were whipped they stood up and tried to pull again</p>
<p>One day Billee fell and could not stand up Hal killed him and threw him into the snow  Buck and the other dogs knew that soon they were going to die too On the next day Koona died and there were only five dogs left Joe Pike Sol leks the one eyed Teek and Buck</p>
<p>It was beautiful spring weather The snow and ice were melting the plants were growing and the forest animals were waking from their winter sleep It was a lovely morning when the two men  and the five dogs pulling Mercedes on the sledge came into John Thornton&#x27;s camp at White River They stopped and the dogs dropped down immediately to rest</p>
<p>John Thornton was mending an axe and he went on working as he talked to Hal</p>
<p>Is it safe to cross the river here  asked Hal</p>
<p>No the ice is too thin It&#x27;s much too dangerous answered Thornton</p>
<p>People have told us that before  laughed Hal  but we got here with no problems</p>
<p>Only somebody very stupid would cross the White River here  said Thornton</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what you think  said Hal  But we&#x27;ve got to get to Dawson  He pickd up his whip  Come on Buck Get up now Let&#x27;s go</p>
<p>Thornton went on working He had warned them but he knew he couldn&#x27;t stop these stupid men from going on</p>
<p>But Buck didn&#x27;t get up Sol-leks stood up slowly then Teek and Joe and finally Pike But Buck stayed where he was The whip came down on him again and again Thornton started to speak then stopped and began to walk up and down</p>
<p>Hal now put down his whip and started to hit Buck with a club But Buck had decided not to get up He had felt thin ice under his feet all day and he saw thin ice in front of him The club hit him again and again but Buck felt almost nothing</p>
<p>Then suddenly  with a wild cry John Thornton jumped on Hal throwing him backwards Mercedes screamed</p>
<p>If you hit that dog again I 11 kill you  Thornton shouted</p>
<p>He&#x27;s my dog  Hal replied There was blood on his face  Get out of my way or I 11 hit you too I&#x27;m going to Dawson</p>
<p>Thornton stood between Hal and Buck and did not move Hal took out his long knife but Thornton knocked it out of his hand Mercedes screamed again Then Thornton picked up Hal&#x27;s knife and cut Buck out of the harness</p>
<p>Hal didn&#x27;t want to fight and Buck was not worth fighting for he was nearly dead  Hal started the sledge and went down towards the river Buck lifted his head and watched the sledge move away Pike was leading and Joe Teek and Sol leks were behind him Hal was walking in front of the sledge and Mercedes was riding on it Charles was walking behind</p>
<p>As Buck watched Thornton felt his body with gentle hands searching for broken bones Buck was very thin very tired and very weak but Thornton didn&#x27;t think he was going to die Then both dog and man watched the sledge as it went slowly out on to the ice in the middle of the river Suddenly the back of the sledge went down and the front went up into the air  Mercedes screamed and Charles turned and took one step back  Then a big piece of ice broke off and dogs sledge and people disappeared there was only a big hole in the ice</p>
<p>John Thornton and Buck looked at one another</p>
<p>You poor thing  said John Thornton and Buck licked his hand</p>
<p>6  For the love of a man</p>
<p>John Thornton had been ill in December and his two friends had had to leave him at White River and go on to Dawson They left him in the camp with plenty of food  and with his two dogs Skeet and Blackie Now the spring had come and he was almost well He lay in the sun by the river with Buck watching the water and listening to the birds slowly getting stronger and stronger</p>
<p>A rest is very welcome after running five thousand kilome tres and Buck slowly got fatter and stronger It was a peace ful lazy time for both man and dogs while they waited for Thornton&#x27;s friends to return from Dawson</p>
<p>Skeet made friends with Buck immediately and while Buck was still very ill  every morning she washed his cuts carefully with her tongue Blackie too was friendly and as Buck grew stronger the three dogs often played games together Sometimes Thornton joined the games too</p>
<p>The days passed very happily and for the first time Buck learned to love He had never loved a man before He and Mr Miller in the Santa Clara valley had been very good friends but Buck had not loved him John Thornton had saved his life but he was also a man who was naturally kind to animals He took very good care of his dogs not because it was sensible to do that  but because he felt they were his children  He was always talking to Buck holding his head and shaking it lovingly In answer Buck liked to take Thornton&#x27;s hand gently in his mouth</p>
<p>Buck was happy to lie on the ground all day and watch Thornton And when Thornton spoke to him or touched him Buck went wild with happiness  At first  he was afraid that Thornton was going to disappear like Perrault and Francois and at night he sometimes woke up and went to the tent to make sure that he was still there</p>
<p>But something was changing in Buck He had lived in the north a long time now and he was almost a wild dog He was happy to sit by Thornton&#x27;s fire but he sat as a wild animal and his dreams were filled with other animals dogs  half wolves and wild wolves They seemed to call him into the forest and sometimes Buck wanted to leave the fire and answer the call But every time he went into the trees his love for Thornton brought him back</p>
<p>It was only Thornton who stopped him going into the forest Other men did not interest him Visitors to the camp tried to make friends with him but Buck stayed cold When Thornton&#x27;s two friends Hans and Pete arrived from Dawson Buck refused to notice them at first Then he saw that they were friends of Thornton&#x27;s and after that he accept ed them but they were not his friends They were like Thornton kind men and they understood that Buck loved Thornton and him alone</p>
<p>Thornton too understood Buck One day Buck and the three men were sitting on some high rocks  a hundred metres above the river Thornton wondered if Buck would obey any order  even a crazy one  Jump Buck  he shouted pointing down to the river A second later the three men were holding Buck back as he tried to jump</p>
<p>That was very strange  said Pete  when they had sat down again</p>
<p>Not strange wonderful  said Thornton  Terrible too Sometimes it frightens me</p>
<p>Yes I feel sorry for any man who hits you when Buck&#x27;s near  said Pete</p>
<p>So do I  said Hans</p>
<p>It happened in the autumn in Circle City A man called Bur ton was starting a fight with another man in a bar Thornton stepped between them to try to stop them Buck was as usual lying in the corner watching Burton hit Thornton and he nearly fell just catching a table Buck flew through the air at Burton&#x27;s throat Burton saved his life by putting up his arm and was thrown on to the ground with Buck on top of him Buck took his teeth out of the man&#x27;s arm and this time bit into his throat Then a crowd of people pulled Buck off and a doctor was called Everyone agreed that Buck had only attacked because he saw Thornton in danger and from that day Buck&#x27;s name became famous all over the north</p>
<p>Later that year Buck saved Thornton in a different way The three men were taking a boat down a fast and rocky river Thornton was in the boat while Hans and Pete moved along the river bank holding the boat with a rope Buck followed them keeping a worried eye on Thornton</p>
<p>They came to a more dangerous part of the river  and the boat started to go too quickly Hans pulled on the rope to stop it and pulled too hard The boat turned over and Thornton was thrown into the water and carried down river towards rocks where no swimmer could live</p>
<p>Buck jumped in immediately and swam three hundred me tres until he reached Thornton Then he turned and with Thornton holding his tail Buck swam towards the river bank But they moved slowly and all the time the river was carrying them towards the place where the water crashed twenty metres down onto rocks Thornton knew that they would not get to the bank quickly enough so he let go of Buck held on to a rock in the middle of the water and shouted  Go Buck go</p>
<p>Buck swam as hard as he could to the bank and Pete and Hans pulled him out</p>
<p>It was hard for Thornton to hold on to his rock in that wild water and his friends knew they had only a few minutes to save him They tied their rope round Buck who at once jumped into the river and tried to swim to Thornton The first time the water took him past the rock and Pete and Hans had to pull him back The second time he swam higher up the river and the water brought him down to Thornton Thornton held on to Buck and Hans and Pete pulled the rope as hard as they could Man and dog disappeared under the water banging into rocks turning over and over sometimes with Buck on top sometimes Thornton When Hans and Pete finally pulled them out both seemed more dead than alive But after a while their eyes opened and life returned</p>
<p>That winter at Dawson Buck did something that made him even more famous in the north It was also very helpful to the three men They wanted to make a journey to look for gold in the east and they needed money They were in a bar one day when some of the men started to talk about dogs One man said that he had a dog who was strong enough to pull a sledge with two hundred kilos on it Another said his dog could pull two hundred and fifty A third man called Matthewson said his dog could pull three hundred kilos</p>
<p>That&#x27;s nothing  said Thornton  Buck can pull three hundred and fifty</p>
<p>Can he break the sledge out when it&#x27;s frozen to the ice and then start it moving And pull it a hundred metres   asked Matthewson</p>
<p>He can break it out and start it and pull it a hundred metres said Thornton</p>
<p>Well  said Matthewson speaking slowly and loudly  I&#x27;ve got a thousand dollars here and I say he can&#x27;t   As he spoke he took a bag of gold and put it down on the table</p>
<p>Suddenly Thornton was worried He knew Buck was strong but was he strong enough  Now ten men were watching him and waiting He didn&#x27;t have a thousand dollars and neither did Hans or Pete</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got a sledge outside with three hundrd and fifty kilos on it  said Matthewson  So it&#x27;s easy if you want to try</p>
<p>Thornton didn&#x27;t know what to say He looked at the other men in the bar One of them was an old friend Jim O Brien</p>
<p>Can yon lend me a thousand dollars Jim  he asked softly</p>
<p>Sure  said O Brien putting another bag of gold next to Matthewson&#x27;s  But I don&#x27;t think the dog can do it John</p>
<p>Everybody went out into the street There were two or three hundred men around Matthewson&#x27;s sledge The sledge had been outside the bar for two hours and it was frozen to the ice in a temperature of 50 below zero Most of the men thought that Buck was not strong enough and Matthewson smiled happily</p>
<p>Shall we make it two thousand dollars  he asked</p>
<p>Thornton Hans and Pete talked for a minute They had only four hundred dollars but they added this to O Brien&#x27;s thousand Matthewson very sure of winning also put down another four hundred dollars</p>
<p>Matthewson&#x27;s ten dogs were taken away and Buck who could feel the excitement in the air was harnessed to the sledge Buck was without question a very fine animal bright-eyed intelligent his thick coat shining with health And he looked as strong as a horse</p>
<p>One man went up to Thornton  I&#x27;ll buy him now  he said  I 11 give you eight hundred dollars for him</p>
<p>Thornton shook his head and sat down on the snow next to Buck He held Buck&#x27;s head in his hands and spoke softly into his ear  If you love me Buck If you love me</p>
<p>Buck took Thornton&#x27;s hand between his teeth then let go and Thornton stood up and stepped back</p>
<p>Ready Buck  he said</p>
<p>Buck pulled on the harness a little  getting ready</p>
<p>Right  cried Thornton</p>
<p>Buck pulled to the right hard stopped suddenly and the ice under the sledge began to break</p>
<p>Now left  called Thornton and Buck pulled to the left breaking more of the ice</p>
<p>Now pull</p>
<p>Buck threw himself against his harness and pulled He held his body low to the ground his head down and forward and his feet dug into the hard snow Harder and harder he pulled Suddenly the sledge moved a centimetre two three and little by little it started to go forward across the snow With each second it went a little faster and Thornton ran be hind calling to Buck as he pulled the sledge towards the end of the hundred metres The watching men were shouting and throwing their hats in the air Buck had won</p>
<p>Then Thornton was on the snow next to Buck again talking to him and Buck had Thornton&#x27;s hand in his teeth</p>
<p>7  The call of the wild</p>
<p>In five minutes Buck had made fourteen hundred dollars  for Thornton and his friends The money made it possi ble for them to travel east where they wanted to look for a lost gold mine Men said that this mine had more gold than any other mine in the north  Many had looked for it and some had died looking for it The only men who knew where it was were now dead</p>
<p>Thornton Pete and Hans with Buck and six other dogs started off to the east in the spring They travelled up the Stewart River and crossed the Mackenzie Mountains They did not move quickly the weather was good and the men shot animals for food when they needed it Sometimes they travelled for a week and sometimes they stopped for a week and searched for gold in the ground Sometimes they were hungry and sometimes they had lots of food They spent all the summer in the mountains carrying everything they needed on their backs sometimes making boats to go down rivers or across lakes</p>
<p>In the autumn they came to a strange flat country with many lakes They travelled on through the winter and met nobody but once they found an old wooden house with an old gun in it</p>
<p>When the spring came they found not the lost mine but a lake in a wide valley Through the shallow water the gold showed like yellow butter  and here their search ended There was gold worth thousands of dollars in the lake and they worked every day filling bag after bag with gold</p>
<p>The dogs had nothing to do except watch the men and eat the food which the men shot for them Buck spent many evenings sitting by the fire</p>
<p>As he sat he saw again his dream world where the strange hairy man sat next to him He also heard something calling him into the forest Sometimes in the middle of the day he lifted his head and listened and then ran off into the forest</p>
<p>One night he woke up and heard the call again a long howl He ran into the forest following the sound and came to an open place in the trees And there  his nose pointing to the sky sat a wolf</p>
<p>The wolf stopped howling and Buck walked slowly towards him The wolf ran  and Buck followed After a time the wolf stopped and waited watching Buck ready to attack But Buck did not want to fight and soon the wolf realized this and the two animals became friendly Then the wolf started to run again and he clearly wanted Buck to follow him They ran for hours through the forest and Buck remembered again his dream world where he and others like him had run through a much older forest</p>
<p>Then they stopped to drink and Buck remembered John Thornton He turned and started to run back The wolf followed him then stopped and howled  but Buck ran on and did not turn</p>
<p>Thornton was eating dinner when Buck returned Buck jumped all over him and for two days never left his side He followed him every where watching him while he ate and while he slept But after two days the call of the wild came again and he remembered the forest and the wolf who had run beside him</p>
<p>He started to sleep out in the forest at night sometimes staying out for three or four days Once he was away for a week fishing and killing animals for food He ate well and he grew stronger and quicker and more alive His golden brown coat shone with health as he ran through the forest learning its every secret every smell and every sound</p>
<p>He&#x27;s the finest dog that I&#x27;ve ever seen  said Thornton to his friends one day as they watched Buck walking out of camp</p>
<p>There 11 never be another dog like him  said Pete</p>
<p>They saw him walking out of camp but they didn&#x27;t see the change that happened when he was inside the forest At once he became a thing of the wild stepping softly and silently a passing shadow among the trees</p>
<p>In the autumn Buck started to see moose in the forest One day he met a group of about twenty The largest was two me tres tall and his antlers were more than two metres across When he saw Buck  he got very angry  For hours Buck fol lowed the moose he wanted the big one but he wanted him alone By the evening Buck had driven the big old moose away from the others and then he began his attack The animal weighed six hundred and fifty kilos he was big enough and strong enough to kill Buck in seconds Patiently Buck fol lowed him for four days attacking and then jumping away He gave him no peace no time to eat or drink or rest  and slowly the moose became weaker At the end of the fourth day Buck pulled the moose down and killed him He stayed by the dead animal for a day and a half eating and then turned towards camp and John Thornton</p>
<p>Five kilometres from the camp he smelt something strange Something was wrong He started to run After a few hundred metres he found the dead body of Blackie with an arrow through his side Then he found another sledge dog dying with an arrow in his neck</p>
<p>Buck was near the camp now and he could hear voices singing Then he saw the body of Hans lying on his face with ten or fifteen arrows in his back Buck was suddenly filled with a wild burning anger</p>
<p>The yeehats were dancing around the camp when they heard a deep and terrible growling Buck came out of the trees faster than the north wind and threw himself on the Yeehats like a mad dog He jumped at the first man and tore out his throat killing him at once He jumped onto a second then a third man going each time for the throat The Yeehats could neither escape nor use their arrows Buck moved like a storm among them tearing biting destroying in a madness that he had never known before Nothing could stop him and soon the Yeehats were running wild with fear back to the forest Buck followed for some time then returned to the camp</p>
<p>He found Pete killed in his bed  He followed Thornton&#x27;s smell to a deep pool and found Skeet lying dead by the edge Thornton&#x27;s body was somewhere under the water</p>
<p>All day Buck stayed by the pool or walked restlessly round the camp  But when the evening came  he heard new sounds from the forest the wolves had come south for the winter and were moving into Buck&#x27;s valley They came into the camp in the moonlight and Buck stood silently waiting for them Suddenly the bravest wolf jumped at Buck In a second Buck had bitten and then stood still again The wolf was dead behind him Three more wolves jumped at him and were killed</p>
<p>Then the pack attacked in a crowd all at once But not one of them could bring Buck down he was too quick too strong too clever for them all After half an hour the pack stopped attacking and moved away Then one wolf moved forward slowly  in a friendly way it was the wolf that Buck had met before in the forest They touched noses Then another wolf came forward to make friends and another Soon the pack was all around Buck and the call of the wild was loud in Buck&#x27;s ears And when the wolves moved on  back into the forest Buck ran with them side by side</p>
<p>That is perhaps the end of Buck&#x27;s story But after a few years the Yeehats noticed that some of the wolves had golden brown in their grey coats They also talked of a Ghost Dog that ran at the head of the pack</p>
<p>And sometimes men were found dead killed by the teeth of a terrible animal And each autumn when the Yeehats follow the moose there is one valley that they will not go into</p>
<p>In the summers there is one visitor to that valley  a large golden-brown wolf larger than any other wolf He walks alone round the lake where the yellow gold shines in the water, and howls But he is
