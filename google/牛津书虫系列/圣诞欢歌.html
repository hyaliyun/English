<p>It is important to remember that Jacob Marley was dead Did Scrooge know that Of course he did</p>
<p>Scrooge and Marley had been partners in London for many years and excellent men of business they were too When Marley died Scrooge continued with the business alone Both names still stood above the office door Scrooge and Marley Sometimes people who were new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge and sometimes Marley but he answered to both names He did not care what name they called him The only thing that mattered to him was the business and making money</p>
<p>Oh He was a hard clever mean old man Scrooge was  There was nothing warm or open about him He lived a secretive lonely life and took no interest in other people at all The cold inside him made his eyes red and his thin lips blue and his voice high and cross It put white frost on his old head his eyebrows and his chin The frost in his heart made the air around him cold too In the hottest days of summer his office was as cold as ice and it was just as cold in winter</p>
<p>Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with a happy smile  My dear Scrooge how are you When will you come to see me  No poor man asked him for money no children asked him the time no man or woman ever in all his life  asked him the way Animals as well as people were afraid of him Dogs used to hide in doorways when they saw him coming But what did Scrooge care It was just what he wanted He liked being on the edge of people&#x27;s busy lives while warning everyone to keep away from him</p>
<p>One Christmas Eve old Scrooge was working busily in his office It was cold frosty foggy weather Outside it was already dark although it was only three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon and there were candles in all the office windows The fog covered everything like a thick grey blanket</p>
<p>Scrooge kept his office door open in order to check that his clerk Bob Cratchit was working Bob spent his days in a dark little room a kind of cupboard next to his employer&#x27;s office Scrooge had a very small fire but Bob&#x27;s fire was much smaller It was very cold in the cupboard and Bob had to wear his long white scarf to try to keep warm</p>
<p>Merry Christmas uncle God bless you  cried a happy voice Scrooge&#x27;s nephew had arrived</p>
<p>Bah  said Scrooge crossly  Humbug</p>
<p>Christmas is humbug Surely you don&#x27;t mean that  uncle  said his nephew</p>
<p>I do  said scrooge  Why do you call it merry Christmas You&#x27;re too poor to be merry</p>
<p>Well  replied the nephew smiling  why are you so cross You&#x27;re too rich to be unhappy</p>
<p>of course I&#x27;m cross  answered the uncle  when I live in a world full of stupid people like you You say Merry Christmas  But what is Christmas Just a time when you spend too much when you find yourself a year older and not an hour richer when you have to pay your bills Everyone who goes around saying Merry Christmas should have his tongue cut out Yes he should</p>
<p>Uncle Please don&#x27;t say that  said the nephew  I&#x27;ve always thought of Christmas as a time to be helpful and kind to other People It&#x27;s the only time of the year when men and women open their hearts freely to each other And so uncle  although I&#x27;ve never made any money from it I think Christmas has been and will be a good time for me And I say God bless Christmas</p>
<p>Bob in the cupboard agreed loudly without thinking He immediately realized his mistake and went quickly back to his work but Scrooge had heard him</p>
<p>If I hear another sound from you  said Scrooge  you&#x27;ll lose you job</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be angry with him uncle  said the nephew  come and have dinner with us tomorrow</p>
<p>Dinner with you I&#x27;ll see you dead first</p>
<p>But why won&#x27;t you come Why</p>
<p>Because Christmas is humbug Good afternoon</p>
<p>I want nothing from you I ask nothing of you Why can&#x27;t we be friends</p>
<p>Good afternoon  said Scrooge</p>
<p>I am sorry with all my heart to find you like this I have never wanted to argue with you But I came to see you and invite you because it&#x27;s Christmas and so I&#x27;ll say a merry Christmas uncle</p>
<p>Good afternoon  said Scrooge</p>
<p>And a happy new year</p>
<p>Good afternoon  said Scrooge</p>
<p>His nephew left the room without an angry word stopping only to wish Bob Cratchit a merry Christmas</p>
<p>Then two other gentlemen came in They were large round comfortable-looking men with books and papers in their hands</p>
<p>This is Scrooge and Marley&#x27;s I think  said one of them  looking at the papers that he was carrying  Am I speaking to Mr Scrooge or Mr Marley</p>
<p>Mr Marley is dead  scrooge replied  He died seven years ago today on Christmas Eve</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure that you are just as kind to the poor as your partner  said the gentleman smiling</p>
<p>What was true was that Scrooge was just as mean as Marley and Marley had been just as mean as Scrooge</p>
<p>At this happy time of year Mr Scrooge  the gentleman went on taking up his pen  we should help poor people who have no food or clothes or homes</p>
<p>Are there no prisons  asked Scrooge coldly</p>
<p>Plenty of prisons  said the gentleman</p>
<p>And the workhouses where poor people can live and work Are they still open</p>
<p>Yes they are I&#x27;m sorry to say</p>
<p>I&#x27;m happy to hear It  said Scrooge  I thought from what you said at first that perhaps these useful places were closed for some reason</p>
<p>But some of us feel  replied the gentleman  that these places don&#x27;t offer enough to poor people We&#x27;re hoping to give some meat and drink and wood for a fire to people who need all these things This is a time when we should all be able to enjoy ourselves How much will you give sir</p>
<p>Nothing  scrooge replied  I don&#x27;t have a merry Christmas myself and I won&#x27;t pay for other people to be merry We all have to pay for prisons and workhouses they cost enough The poor will have to go there</p>
<p>Many can&#x27;t go there and many prefer to die</p>
<p>If they prefer to die why don&#x27;t they die then There are too many people in the world so it&#x27;s a good thing if some of them die All this is none of my business It&#x27;s enough for a man to understand his own business and not to think about other people&#x27;s I&#x27;m a very busy man Good afternoon gentlemen</p>
<p>The gentlemen shook their heads a little sadly and left the office Scrooge went back to his work feeling pleased with himself</p>
<p>Now the fog was at its thickest outside and the cold was biting Lights shone brightly from the shop windows People were hurrying here and there rich and poor alike to buy what they needed for tomorrow&#x27;s Christmas dinner</p>
<p>At last it was time to close the office Scrooge got up slowly from his desk Bob was waiting for this moment and he immediately put on his hat</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll want a holiday all day tomorrow I suppose  said Scrooge</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t mind sir</p>
<p>I do mind It&#x27;s not fair I have to pay you for a day&#x27;s work when you don&#x27;t do any work</p>
<p>It&#x27;s only once a year sir  said Bob politely</p>
<p>That&#x27;s no reason for robbing me every twenty-fifth of December  said Scrooge putting on his coat  But I suppose you must have it Be here early next morning</p>
<p>Yes sir I will I promise  Bob said happily Scrooge walked out without another word When bob had closed the office he ran home to his family in Camden Town as quickly as possible</p>
<p>Scrooge always used to eat his dinner alone in the same miserable little eating-house Tonight was no different from other nights He read the newspapers looked at his bank books  and went home to bed He lived in rooms which had once belonged to his dead partner They were in an old dark building in a lonely side street where no one except Scrooge lived</p>
<p>In the blackness of the night through the fog and the frost  Scrooge had to feel his way along the street with his hands He finally reached his front door and put the key in the lock Suddenly to his great surprise he saw that the knocker was not a knocker any more but had become the face of Jacob Marley</p>
<p>He had not thought of his partner for seven years until that afternoon when he spoke Marley&#x27;s name to his visitors But there in front of him was Marley&#x27;s face white and ghostly  with terrible staring eyes</p>
<p>As Scrooge looked it became a knocker again He was afraid but he did not show his fear He turned the key  opened the door and walked in He did look around before he shut the door and he did look behind the door to see if anyone was hiding there But there was nothing there He shut the door with a bang to show that he was not afraid</p>
<p>With his one candle he went slowly up the stairs It was impossible to see into all the dark corners Darkness was cheap  and Scrooge liked it But he remembered the face so he walked through all his rooms checking that everything was all right Nobody under the table or the bed nobody behind the door On the small fire in the bedroom there was a pot of soup and Scrooge&#x27;s bowl was ready on the table Nobody in any of the rooms Sure that he was safe now Scrooge shut and locked his bedroom door behind him He sat down by the fire to eat his soup</p>
<p>The fireplace was an old one with hundreds of pictures on the tiles around the fire But Scrooge could only see Marley&#x27;s face on every tile</p>
<p>Humbug  said Scrooge to the tiles and walked across the room When he sat down again he noticed a bell on the other side of the room As he looked he saw with great surprise and fear that the bell was slowly beginning to move from side to side Soon it was ringing loudly and so was every bell in the house</p>
<p>Suddenly they all stopped ringing at the same moment and then came a strange noise from down below It sounded like someone pulling heavy chains across the floor Scrooge remembered hearing that ghosts in old houses sometimes pulled chains behind them Then a door below opened with a crash and the noise started coming up the stairs It was coming towards his door</p>
<p>It&#x27;s humbug still  cried Scrooge But the colour left his face when without stopping it came straight through the heavy locked door and appeared in front of him It was Marley&#x27;s ghost</p>
<p>Scrooge could see right through its body Around its middle was a long chain which had money-boxes keys bank books  and heavy purses on it The ghost&#x27;s death-cold eyes stared fixedly at Scrooge</p>
<p>Well  said Scrooge trying to pretend that nothing strange was happening  What do you want And who are you</p>
<p>In life I was your partner Jacob Marley</p>
<p>It&#x27;s humbug I tell you  said Scrooge  There are no ghosts  But when he said this the ghost gave a terrible cry  and shook its chain in a very frightening way At once Scrooge fell on the ground in great fear crying  Yes Yes You are real I see that now Why have you come Why do ghosts come back from the dead Tell me Jacob</p>
<p>The spirit of every man who does not help other people in life has to travel endlessly through the world after his death We have to carry the chains that we made for ourselves in our lifetime Do you Ebenezer Scrooge recognize my chain It is very like the one that you wear</p>
<p>Scrooge looked around him but could see no chain  Jacob  he said  please tell me more</p>
<p>I cannot help you much Ebenezer I cannot rest I cannot stay anywhere for long I have been dead for seven years and all that time I have been travelling on the wings of the wind  No peace no rest for me in death because I was never good or kind in life</p>
<p>But you were always a good man of business Jacob  said Scrooge who was now beginning to worry about his own life</p>
<p>Business  cried the ghost miserably  Why didn&#x27;t I think of people as my business I thought only about making money not about being kind and helpful to other people Listen to me Ebenezer I am here tonight to warn you You still have a chance to save yourself from what has happened to me Three spirtis will come to visit you the first tomorrow at one o&#x27;clock the second at the same time the next night and the third at midnight the following night You will not see me any more and for your own peace after death remember what I have told you</p>
<p>The spirit walked slowly backwards to the window which began to open When the ghost reached the window it held up its hand and Scrooge listened He could hear a noise of sad crying in the air The spirit began to cry too and it moved out into the frosty dark night to join the others Scrooge ran to the window Outside the air was full of spirits all wearing chains like Marley&#x27;s ghost all crying miserably as they realized too late the terrible mistakes that they had made in their lives</p>
<p>Little by little the spirits and their voices disappeared into the fog and the darkness and the night was silent again Scrooge closed the window and checked his bedroom door It was still locked He started to say  Humbug  but stopped suddenly Perhaps because he was very tired or because it was late he went straight to bed without taking off his clothes and fell asleep immediately</p>
<p>2  The first of the three spirits</p>
<p>When Scrooge woke up it was very dark in the room He heard the church clock start striking and listened to see what the time was To his great surprise the heavy bell went on striking up to twelve then stopped Twelve o&#x27;clock  It was past two in the morning when he had gone to bed The clock must be wrong He looked at his watch It said twelve o&#x27;clock too</p>
<p>Have I slept all day Is it the next night already  scrooge asked himself  Or has something happened to the sun Perhaps it&#x27;s midday not midnight But that&#x27;s impossible</p>
<p>He climbed out of bed and felt his way to the window But there was nobody outside in the dark foggy streets and he realized it must be night-time He went back to bed again but could not sleep He was worried because he could not understand what was happening  Was Marley&#x27;s ghost a dream  he wondered  But it seemed very real</p>
<p>He lay awake until he heard the clock striking a quarter to the hour Suddenly he remembered The ghost had warned him that a spirit would visit him at one o&#x27;clock He decided to stay awake until one o&#x27;clock had passed The quarter of an hour passed very slowly but at last he heard the clock striking the four quarters</p>
<p>It&#x27;s one o&#x27;clock  cried Scrooge delightedly  and nothing has happened  But he spoke before the hour bell had sounded The clock now struck a deep sad ONE and immediately light shone into Scrooge&#x27;s bedroom The curtains round his bed were pulled open Scrooge sat up in bed and stared at his ghostly visitor</p>
<p>A strange figure half like a child half like an old man  looked back at him It had long white hair but its skin was soft and young It wore a short white robe covered with both summer and winter flowers But the strangest thing about it was that from the top of its head shone a bright clear light Perhaps this light was sometimes too bright because under one arm it carried a hat which looked like a large extinguisher</p>
<p>Who and what are you sir  asked Scrooge</p>
<p>I am the ghost of Christmas Past  replied the spirit in a soft gentle voice</p>
<p>Do you mean long ago in the past  asked Scrooge</p>
<p>No Your past</p>
<p>Spirit please tell me why you are here</p>
<p>I am here for your own good  answered the ghost</p>
<p>Thank you  replied Scrooge politely But secretly he thought  Bah A night of unbroken sleep is a more useful thing to have</p>
<p>The spirit seemed to hear him thinking and said at once  I am here to help you change your life Watch and listen  It put out a strong hand and held Scrooge by the arm  Get up and come with me</p>
<p>It was dark and cold outside Scrooge did not want to go anywhere and for a moment he thought about pretending to be too ill to go out But he did not like to refuse so he said nothing and got out of bed Together they passed through the wall of the house out into the darkness</p>
<p>Suddenly Scrooge realized they were standing on an open country road with fields on each side London the fog and the darkness had all disappeared and it was a clear cold  winter day with snow on the ground</p>
<p>Good Heavens  cried Scrooge  I was born near here I rememher it well</p>
<p>The spirit looked kindly at the old man  How strange that you&#x27;ve forgotten it for so many years What is that on your face Are you crying</p>
<p>Scrooge put a hand over his eyes  It&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;ve got a cold that&#x27;s all Take me where you want spirit</p>
<p>Scrooge recognized every field post and tree as they walked along the road towards a little market town All around thgm were young schoolboys on horses and in farmers carts laughing and wishing each other a merry Christmas as they travelled to their homes for the Christmas holiday</p>
<p>They are only shadows from the past  said the spirit  They cannot see us</p>
<p>Scrooge knew and named all of them Why was he so delighted to see them Why did his cold heart beat faster when they went past shouting Merry Christmas   What was merry Christmas to Scrooge What good had it ever done to him</p>
<p>Not everyone has left the school  said the ghost  There is one lonely child there still one child whose friends have all gone</p>
<p>I know  said Scrooge And now he was crying openly</p>
<p>They turned into a smaller road and soon came to the school Inside in the long cold silent classroom a lonely boy sat reading near a small fire When he saw his poor forgotten past self Scrooge sat down at one of the desks put his head in his hands and cried</p>
<p>Poor boy I wish but it&#x27;s too late now</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the matter  asked the spirit</p>
<p>There was a boy singing Christmas carols at my door yesterday I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t give him anything that&#x27;s all</p>
<p>The ghost smiled and lifted its hand saying  Let&#x27;s see another past Christmas</p>
<p>The schoolroom became darker and dirtier There was the young Scrooge again a little older and bigger than before He was not reading this time but was walking up and down  looking very unhappy The door opened and a little girl  much younger than him came running in Putting her arms round his neck she said lovingly to him  I&#x27;ve come to bring you home dear brother Father is so much kinder than he used to be The other day I asked him if you could come home and he said yes And we&#x27;re going to spend Christmas together and have the merriest time  she was laughing delightedly as she began to pull him towards the door They went out happily together hand in hand</p>
<p>What a warm heart she had  said the ghost</p>
<p>You&#x27;re right  said Scrooge  I agree with you spirit</p>
<p>She married I understand  continued the ghost  and had children I think before she died</p>
<p>One child  answered Scrooge</p>
<p>True  said the ghost  Your nephew</p>
<p>Scrooge did not answer at once  Yes  he said at last</p>
<p>Now the school had disappeared and they were in the middle of a busy town with shadowy crowds and carts all around them Here it was Christmas time again but it was evening  and there were lights in the shops and streets</p>
<p>The ghost stopped at an office door  Do you know this place Scrooge  he asked</p>
<p>Know it  cried Scrooge  Why I was a clerk here</p>
<p>They went in and when they saw a large kind-looking old gentleman sitting at a high desk Scrooge cried excitedly  Good Heavens it&#x27;s old Fezziwig God bless him It&#x27;s Fezziwig alive again</p>
<p>Old Fezziwig put down his pen and looked at the clock Fastening his coat buttons over his fat stomach he started laughing as he called out in a rich deep happy voice   Ebenezer Dick Seven o&#x27;clock No more work tonight It&#x27;sChristmas Eve remember</p>
<p>The young Scrooge hurried in with another clerk</p>
<p>That&#x27;s Dick Wilkins  said Scrooge quietly to the ghost</p>
<p>He always liked me Oh dear poor Dick</p>
<p>Together the two young clerks put away all the pens and papers and following Fezziwig&#x27;s orders cleared all the furniture away from the centre of the room In came a fiddler In came Mrs Fezziwig fat and smiling In came the three Fezziwig daughters sweet and pretty In came the six young men who were in love with them In came the cook with her young man the milkman In came the boy from next door  with the girl from the house opposite In they came some quietly some noisily but all happy because it was Ghristmas Eve The fiddler started playing and away they all went in the dance twenty pairs at the same time round and round  down the middle and up again When they were all tired old Fezziwig cried out  Well done Now have something to eat and drink  there was cake and hot meat and bread and cold meat and fruit and all kinds of drinks on a long table near the door And after they had eaten they danced again</p>
<p>When the clock struck eleven the dancing ended Mr and Mrs Fezziwig stood by the door shaking hands with each person as he or she went out and wishing him or her a merry Christmas</p>
<p>During this time Scrooge had thought of nothing except what was happening in front of his eyes He remembered and enjoyed it all with the greatest delight But when the dancing came to an end he realized that the ghost was looking at him The light on the spirit&#x27;s head was burning very clearly</p>
<p>It seems easy enough to amuse these childish people  said the ghost  It was nothing much that Fezziwig did was it  After all he only spent a few pounds on food and drink and paying the fiddler</p>
<p>It isn&#x27;t a question of money  replied Scrooge warmly He was speaking like the young man he used to be not the old man he was now  No spirit you see our employer can make us happy or sad His words his looks all these things are so important The happiness that he gives is just as valuable as money</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped speaking when he felt the spirit watching him closely</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the matter  asked the ghost</p>
<p>Er nothing  said Scrooge  Just that I&#x27;d like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk now</p>
<p>Now Scrooge could see himself again He was older now  and it was clear that he was beginning to show an unhealthy interest in money His eyes were restless and his mouth looked thin and mean He was not alone but was sitting beside a lovely young girl The light that shone brightly from the ghost of Christmas Past showed that she was crying</p>
<p>I know it doesn&#x27;t matter very much to you  she said softly  You care about gold more than you care about me Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be sad Money will give you the happiness that I wanted to give you</p>
<p>But I haven&#x27;t changed towards you have I</p>
<p>You have changed We promised to marry a long time ago when we were both poor and happy to be poor I have stayed the same but you have different hopes and dreams now I loved the man that you used to be but I know that you do not wish to marry me any more So I&#x27;ve come to tell you that you&#x27;re free Be happy in the life that you&#x27;ve chosen  And she left him</p>
<p>Spirit  cried Scrooge  Show me no more Take me home This is too painful</p>
<p>One shadow more  said the ghost</p>
<p>No more  cried Scrooge  I don&#x27;t wish to see any more  But the spirit held his arms and he could not escape</p>
<p>Now they were in another place in a room which was not very large but comfortable Near the fire sat a beautiful young girl Scrooge thought she was the girl that he had just seen until he saw her now a good-looking married lady sitting opposite her daughter The room was full of children and noise and shouting and laughing Just then the door opened  and the father entered carrying a great pile of Christmas presents The noise became twice as loud as the children received their presents with delight and kissed their father gratefully Finally the younger ones went upstairs to bed and Scrooge watched more sadly than ever as the father sat down with his loving daughter and her mother by the fire</p>
<p>Belle  said the husband turning to his wife with a smile  I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon Guess who  Mr Scrooge He was sitting alone in his office His partner is dying and I don&#x27;t think he has any other friends</p>
<p>Spirit  said Scrooge in a broken voice  Take me away from this place</p>
<p>These are shadows of the things that happened in the past  said the ghost  You chose the life that you preferred  so why cry now</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t watch any more It&#x27;s too awful Leave me alone  spirit  And Scrooge noticing that the ghostly light was burning high and bright suddenly took the extinguisher and pushed it down hard on the spirit&#x27;s head But although it covered the ghost&#x27;s head and body Scrooge could not hide the light which continued to shine out strongly from underneath</p>
<p>Now Scrooge found himself back in his own bedroom again Feeling very tired he climbed into bed and at once fell into a deep heavy sleep</p>
<p>3  The second of the three spirits</p>
<p>When Scrooge woke up he realized immediately that the church clock was just going to strike one He felt sure that the second spirit would Soon visit him This time he wanted to be ready so he pulled back all the curtains round his bed himself and lay there waiting At one o&#x27;clock instead of a spirit a strong light shone down on Scrooge&#x27;s bed He felt very frightened After a few minutes he thought that perhaps the light was coming from the next room so he got up and went to the door When he touched it a strange voice called his name and asked him to enter He obeyed</p>
<p>Although he recognized it as his own room it looked very different now The walls were covered with bright green leaves and there was a good fire burning in the fireplace On the floor were big plies of the best Christmas food wonderful rich dark cakes warm soft bread colourful apples and oranges plates of yellow butter cooked chickens boxes of chocolates and sugared sweets Sitting beside all this was a large smiling spirit who called out cheerfully to Scrooge   Come in Chme in man I am the ghost of Christmas Present Look at me</p>
<p>Since the first ghost&#x27;s visit Scrooge was no longer very sure of himself So although the spirit&#x27;s eyes were clear and kind Scrooge was afraid to look straight into its face But he could see that its body was dressed in a long green robe its long brown hair fell freely down its back and its face wore a warm and friendly smile Light shone from the torch which it was holding in its strong right hand</p>
<p>Spirit  said Scrooge quietly  take me where you want Last night I learned a lesson which is working now If you have anything to teach me tonight let me learn from you</p>
<p>Touch my robe  said the spirit and Scrooge obeyed</p>
<p>The food the room the fire all disappeared and they were standing outside in the cold snowy streets on Christmas morning Althought the sky was grey and the streets were dirty the people looked surprisingly cheerful as they hurried to the bakers&#x27;shops with their Christmas dinners all ready for cooking The spirit seemed specially interested in poor people He stood with Scrooge in a baker&#x27;s doorway and held his torch over the dinners as they were carried past him Sometimes when he saw people pushing each other or getting angry he lifted his torch over their heads and immediately they became kinder or stopped arguing  because it&#x27;s Christmas  they told each other</p>
<p>What does your torch do spirit  asked Scrooge</p>
<p>It gives a special taste to people&#x27;s dinners on this day  answered the spirit</p>
<p>Why do you use it most on poor people  said Scrooge</p>
<p>Because poor people need it most  was the reply</p>
<p>They went on through London and came to the small house where Scrooge&#x27;s clerk lived Here the spirit smiled and held his torch high over the door Inside Bob Cratchit&#x27;s wife and second daughter Belinda in their everyday dresses but looking clean and pretty were putting plates on the table for their Christmas dinner Bob&#x27;s son Peter was helping to cook the potatoes and two smaller Cratchits a boy and a girl were running round excitedly Just then the eldest daughter Martha arrived home from work</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s Martha mother  cried the two young Cratchits happily  We&#x27;re having a really big chicken for dinner  Martha  In fact it was only a small chicken but it seemed large to the excited children</p>
<p>My dear how late you are  said Mrs Cratchit kissing her daughter several times</p>
<p>We were so busy yesterday mother  replied the girl  That&#x27;s why we didn&#x27;t finish until this morning</p>
<p>Well Never mind now that you&#x27;re here God bless you  Sit down by the fire my dear</p>
<p>No no Father&#x27;s coming  ried the two young Cratchits  Hide Martha hide</p>
<p>So Martha hid herself and in came Bob in his thin coat and long white scarf with his son Tiny Tim in his arms Poor Tiny Tim He had not walked since he was born and although he could pull himself and his thin little legs along with the help of a wooden crutch he was not strong enough to travel far alone</p>
<p>Why where&#x27;s Martha  cried Bob looking round</p>
<p>Not coming  said Mrs Cratchit</p>
<p>Not coming  repeated Bob his cheerful smile disappearing  Not coming on Christmas Day</p>
<p>But Martha didn&#x27;t like to worry her father for a minute so she ran out from behind the door and kissed him  while the two young Cratchits showed Tiny Tim the chicken now ready to eat</p>
<p>Scrooge and the spirit watched as the family sat down to eat It was a poor enough meal but to them it seemed wonderful and they ate every bit of it</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the best chicken I&#x27;ve ever tasted  said Bob  smiling round at his family  who  with their mouths full all agreed</p>
<p>And then the most exciting moment of the day Belinda put a clean plate in front of each person  and they all turned to look at Mrs Cratchit as she came in from the kitchen Her face was hot from her morning&#x27;s work  but she was smiling happily as she carried in-the Christmas pudding  in its little circle of blue fire</p>
<p>Oh it was a wonderful pudding They were all delighted with it</p>
<p>It&#x27;s your greatest success in all the years that we&#x27;ve been married my dear  said Bob</p>
<p>Well I did wonder how much fruit to put in it  said his wife  but  yes  it&#x27;s a good one  And she laughed just like a young girl</p>
<p>Nobody said that it was a very small pudding for a large family Nobody even thought it No Cratchit ever said or thought things like that</p>
<p>At last when they had finished their meal the children cleared the table and washed the plates Then they all sat round the fire  eating apples and oranges There was a large bowl of fruit and sugar and hot water and something a little stronger but only three people could drink at the same time  because the family only owned two glasses and a cup But this did not worry the Cratchits at all Now Bob lifted his glass and said  A merry Christmas to us all  my dears  God bless us</p>
<p>The family repeated his wish and Tiny Tim said last of all  God bless us every one  He sat very close to his father  on a small chair Bob held his son&#x27;s thin little hand in this own The boy had a special place in his father&#x27;s heart</p>
<p>Spirit  said Scrooge with an interest that he had never felt before   tell me if Tiny Tim will live</p>
<p>In the future I see an empty chair by the fire  with a crutch beside it If these shadows do not change  the child will die</p>
<p>No no  said Scrooge  Oh no kind spirit Say that he will live</p>
<p>If his life does not change soon  he will die before next Christmas What does that matter There are too many people in the world so it&#x27;s a good thing if some of them die</p>
<p>Scrooge was ashamed and sad to hear his own words spoken by the spirit But he lifted his head when he heard his name</p>
<p>Mr Scrooge  said Bob  Let&#x27;s drink to Mr Scrooge  whose money has paid for this meal</p>
<p>His money  said Mrs Cratchit angrily  What can we buy with his fifteen shillings a week  Why should we drink to the health of a hateful hard unfeeling mean old man like Scrooge</p>
<p>My dear  said Bob gently  remember it&#x27;s Christmas</p>
<p>Well Bob  I&#x27;ll drink to his health only because of you and because it&#x27;s Christmas Long life to Mr Scrooge A merry Christmas and a happy new year to him  He&#x27;ll be very merry and very happy I&#x27;m sure</p>
<p>When the children heard Scrooge&#x27;s name a dark shadow came over their happiness for a while and they were quiet and a little sad But five minutes later they were talking and laughing and telling stories ten times merrier than before They were not a good-looking or a well-dressed family  but they were happy and grateful and loved each other As they disappeared in the light of the spirit&#x27;s torch Scrooge could not take his eyes off them  especially Tiny Tim</p>
<p>By this time it was getting dark and snowing heavily The spirit took Scrooge into many houses where fires were burning cheerfully and food was cooking and people were merrily welcoming their friends and families into their homes The ghost was delighted to see all this excitement and made sure that he lifted his torch over every poor family to give them more fun and better food and greater happiness</p>
<p>Then the spirit took Scrooge away from the busy capital to a wild lonely place in the country where no trees grew Here they visited a small stone house  a long way from any town or village  where an old man and woman were singing Christmas carols with their children and grandchildren The spirit did not stay long here  but told Scrooge to hold his robe again</p>
<p>Where are we going  Not up in the air  surely  And Scrooge terribly frightened looked down as they flew over the land and then over the sea It was stormy  windy weather  and the waves crashed violently underneath them</p>
<p>The spirit took Scrooge to a lighthouse built on a lonely rock  several miles from land A light was kept burning at the top  in order to warn sailors to keep away from the dangerous rocks Two men lived here in this cold  unfriendly place  far away from their families but the spirit smiled to see them shake hands wish each other a merry Christmas and sing a carol together in front of their fire</p>
<p>Again the spirit and Scrooge flew on and together they landed on a ship in the middle of the sea Here every man  although many miles from home had a kind word for his friend  or thought warmly of his family because it was Christmas</p>
<p>It was a great surprise to Scrooge while listening to the noise of the wind and waves to hear a happy laugh He recognized it as his nephew&#x27;s and found himself with the smiling spirit beside him in his nephew&#x27;s bright warm sitting-room</p>
<p>When Scrooge&#x27;s nephew laughed everybody who was with him wanted to laugh too He had that kind of laugh And at the moment  his very pretty wife and several of his friends were laughing with him</p>
<p>He said that Christmas was humbug Ha ha ha  cried Scrooge&#x27;s nephew</p>
<p>That&#x27;s very bad of him Fred  said his wife</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a strange old man  said Scrooge&#x27;s nephew  but I&#x27;m sorry for him His money is no use to him you see He isn&#x27;t at all happy or comfortable although he&#x27;s rich It&#x27;s sad to think of him sitting alone in his cold room And so I&#x27;m going to invite him every Christmas He can be cross and miserable if be likes but I&#x27;ll go on inviting him and one day perhaps he&#x27;ll think better of Christmas</p>
<p>After tea the cheerful little group sang songs and played music Scrooge recognized the song that his little sister used to sing  and remembered sadly what the ghost of Christmas Past had shown him Later the friends played guessing games and Scrooge joined in the games with delight Nobody except the spirit could hear him but he often guessed the right answer</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to go now  said the ghost smiling at the old man&#x27;s childish excitement</p>
<p>No spirit please let me stay a little longer Look  they&#x27;re playing a new game</p>
<p>It was a game called Yes and No in which Scrooge&#x27;s nephew had to think of something and the others had to ask questions to discover what it was The only possible answers were Yes or No Scrooge heard that Fred was thinking of a living animal a wild animal sometimes an angry animal  which lived in London and walked in the streets Every time he answered a question Fred could not stop himself laughing At last his wife&#x27;s dark  pretty sister started laughing too</p>
<p>I know what it is Fred I know  she cried out  It&#x27;s your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge</p>
<p>Everyone laughed until they cried What a wonderful game  What a clever idea of Fred&#x27;s But at last Fred dried his eyes  and said  We&#x27;ve been very merry because of him  so I think we should drink to his health Here&#x27;s to Uncle Scrooge A merry Christmas and a happy new year to the old man Uncle Scrooge</p>
<p>To Uncle Scrooge  they all cried cheerfully lifting their glasses</p>
<p>Uncle Scrooge wanted to thank them but the spirit hurried him away The ghost seemed much older now  his brown hair had become grey</p>
<p>Are spirits&#x27; lives so short  asked Scrooge</p>
<p>My life in this world ends at midnight tonight Listen It&#x27;s a quarter to midnight now</p>
<p>The church clock was striking the three quarters</p>
<p>Excuse me for asking spirit  said Scrooge  but what are those strange things near your foot</p>
<p>Oh man  look here  said the spirit sadly and brought out from under his robe two ghostly figures  a boy and a girl They were thin and poorly dressed  with cold  mean eyes and dry yellow skin  and their faces showed only a frightening and murderous hate Scrooge had never seen anything so terrible or so sad</p>
<p>These miserable children are Man&#x27;s  said the spirit  The boy is Crime The girl is Need They will destroy Man if nothing is done about them</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t anyone help them  cried Scrooge</p>
<p>Are there no prisons  said the spirit turning on Scrooge for the last time with his own words  Are there on workhouses</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve Scrooge looked but could no longer see the ghost or the children He was alone again</p>
<p>4  The last of the spirits</p>
<p>The third spirit will come at midnight  scrooge suddenly remembered the words of Jacob Marley&#x27;s ghost and lifting his eyes saw a spirit all in black coming slowly towards him It was a tall silent figure wearing a long black robe which hid its head and body When it came close to him it stopped and pointed onwards with one hand Scrooge was more afraid of this spirit than he had been of the others and his voice was shaking as he asked  Are you the spirit of Christmas Yet to Come  the ghost neither spoke nor moved but still pointed onwards</p>
<p>Are you going to show me shadows of the things which haven&#x27;t happened yet  but will happen in the future  scrooge asked</p>
<p>There was no answer</p>
<p>Ghost of the future  he continued  You frighten me very much but I think you can help me to change my life I&#x27;ll be very grateful to you if you show me the future Won&#x27;t you speak to me</p>
<p>Again no reply</p>
<p>Well show me the way spirit  said Scrooge finally  The night is passing and time is valuable to me I know</p>
<p>The ghost moved away with Scrooge following in its shadow Suddenly they were in the heart of the capital among the businessmen and moneylenders The ghost pointed to one small group of men so Scrooge went closer to listen to their conversation</p>
<p>No I don&#x27;t know much about it  said one fat man  I only know he&#x27;s dead</p>
<p>When did he die  asked another man</p>
<p>Last night I think</p>
<p>Why what was the matter with him  asked a third</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve no idea  replied the fat man looking bored  who cares</p>
<p>What&#x27;s he done with his money  asked a red-faced gentleman</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t heard  said the fat man  He hasn&#x27;t left it to me  that&#x27;s all I know</p>
<p>They all laughed at this Scrooge knew the men  and looked towards the spirit  hoping it would explain what the conversation meant But the ghost moved on pointing at two more men Scrooge listened again He knew these men well They were rich and important  and he had often done business with them</p>
<p>How are you  said one</p>
<p>How are you  replied the other</p>
<p>Well  said the first  The old man has died at last has he</p>
<p>So they tell me  replied the second  Cold isn&#x27;t it</p>
<p>Nice and frosty for Christmas Good morning</p>
<p>Not another word That was the end of their meeting</p>
<p>Scrooge wondered why the spirit wanted him to hear these conversations What could they mean The dead man could not be his partner Jacob because he was already dead</p>
<p>Scrooge watched carefully trying to understand He looked round for his own shadow but could not see himself anywhere  Perhaps that&#x27;s not surprising  he thought  because if I change my life and I&#x27;m planning to do that I won&#x27;t be the same person in the future  Just then he noticed the spirit standing quiet and dark beside him  with its pointing hand He felt the unseen eyes staring fixedly at him behind the black robe Scrooge&#x27;s body shook and he felt cold</p>
<p>They left the busy offices and banks and went to another part of the capital where Scrooge had never been before The streets were narrow and dirty the houses miserably poor the people unwashed and half-dressed Down one street there was a small shop  where an old man was sitting waiting for customers His business was buying old furniture or clothes and selling them again to the poorest people in London As Scrooge and the spirit watched three women arrived at the shop door at the same time  each carrying a large bundle They looked very surprised and a little ashamed to see each other Suddenly they all started laughing</p>
<p>Ladies you couldn&#x27;t find a better place to meet  said Joe  the old man getting up  Now come inside and show me what you&#x27;ve got to sell</p>
<p>Inside the first woman put her bundle on the table and said  I don&#x27;t care if everybody knows where this comes from  We all have to take care of ourselves  He always did</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right  agreed the second woman</p>
<p>Very true  agreed the third</p>
<p>Does a dead man need these things  continued the first woman  And why was he so mean while he was alive  We all worked for him didn&#x27;t we  Cleaned his house washed his clothes cooked his soup  And what did we get Three shillings a week It&#x27;s no surprise that he died alone  with no friends around him</p>
<p>You never spoke a truer word  said the second</p>
<p>He was a bad man we all know that  said the third</p>
<p>Now what have we here  said old Joe opening the women&#x27;s bundles  Buttons pencils boots silver spoons some excellent bed-curtains blankets and a very good shirt  he added feeling the fine cotton</p>
<p>Yes it was his best  said the first woman  They put it on him after he died But he doesn&#x27;t need it now that he&#x27;s dead And the blankets and bed-curtains He doesn&#x27;t need them either</p>
<p>You took the shirt off a dead body and the blankets and curtains off his bed while he was lying there Well well  said Joe shaking his head  Here&#x27;s your money  And he counted out several shillings into the women&#x27;s hands</p>
<p>Ha ha ha  laughed the first woman  He frightened everyone away when he was alive and we&#x27;ve made money out of him now that he&#x27;s dead  Ha ha ha</p>
<p>Scrooge felt sick and angry at the same time  Spirit  he said  I see now I could be that unhappy man Good Heavens  what&#x27;s this</p>
<p>Joe and the women had disappeared and Scrooge was standing in a dark room Opposite him was a bed  with no blankets or curtains A light shone down from above on to the body of a dead man covered with a sheet</p>
<p>How sad  thought Scrooge  to die with no friends or family around him  To lie in an empty room with no candles or flowers and robbed of his clothes To know that nobody loves him  because he loved nobody in his life Money can&#x27;t buy a happy life or a peaceful death  He looked at the spirit  whose hand was pointing at the man&#x27;s covered head It would be easy to lift the sheet and see who the man was But for some reason Scrooge could not do it</p>
<p>Spirit  he said  this is a terrible place Let&#x27;s go</p>
<p>Still the ghost&#x27;s unmoving finger pointed at the man&#x27;s head</p>
<p>I understand you but I can&#x27;t look at him spirit I can&#x27;t  said Scrooge wildly  If there&#x27;s anyone in this town who feels anything at this man&#x27;s death  show that person to me  spirit  please</p>
<p>For a moment the spirit lifted its dark robe like a wing and showed Scrooge a room  where a mother and her children were sitting The young woman kept looking at the clock and when her husband arrived  she hurried to meet him</p>
<p>What what is the news  she asked him worriedly  Is it good  or  or bad</p>
<p>There is still hope Caroline  he replied</p>
<p>How can there be hope If that hard mean old man wants us to pay back the money now they&#x27;ll send us to prison We haven&#x27;t got enough to pay him</p>
<p>He is dead Caroline  answered her husband</p>
<p>Thank God for that  cried the young woman from her heart The next moment she realized what she had said  Oh  I didn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m sorry if anyone dies</p>
<p>Perhaps the person who inherits his business will give us more time to pay the money back And we&#x27;ll have the money by then Tonight we can sleep well Caroline</p>
<p>So spirit  said Scrooge in a broken voice  you can show me only happiness at this man&#x27;s death It frightens me spirit Show me please that there can be sadness at a death</p>
<p>The ghost took him silently through the streets to poor Bob Cratchit&#x27;s house The room seemed strangely quiet The mother and her daughters were making a small white cotton shirt together while the usually noisy young Cratchits sat silently in a corner and Peter was reading a book Mrs Cratchit put her work down on the table and covered her face with her hand</p>
<p>The colour hurts my eyes  she said The colour Ah poor Tiny Tim</p>
<p>They&#x27;re a little better now  she went on  It&#x27;s difficult to work by candlelight And I don&#x27;t want to show red eyes to your father when he comes home</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a bit late  said Peter  but I think he&#x27;s walked more slowly these last few days mother</p>
<p>They were very quiet again At last she said bravely  I&#x27;ve known him walk with with Tiny Tim in his arms very fast indeed</p>
<p>So have I  cried Peter  Often</p>
<p>But he was very light to carry and your father loved him so much And there&#x27;s your father at the door now  she got up quickly to kiss Bob as he came in He looked tired and thin  and needed his long scarf poor man Martha took his boots and scarf off and Belinda brought him his tea and the little Cratchits sat close to him He was very cheerful with all of them and was pleased with the little shirt that his wife and daughters were making</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be ready long before Sunday won&#x27;t it  he said</p>
<p>Sunday You went there today then Bob  asked his wife</p>
<p>Yes my dear You&#x27;d love to see it It&#x27;s a beautiful green place But you&#x27;ll see it often I promised him that we would go there every Sunday My little little child  cried Bob hiding his face in his hands He had loved the boy very much</p>
<p>He went upstairs to the quiet bedroom where the chlid lay Poor Bob sat down beside him  and when he felt calmer  he kissed the little face and went downstairs again almost happy</p>
<p>My dears  he said to his children  one of these days some of you will marry and leave home In a few year&#x27;s time perhaps all of you will But I&#x27;m sure none of us will ever forget Tiny Tim will we</p>
<p>Never father  they all cried</p>
<p>And I know  said Bob  that when we remember how patient and gentle he was although he was only a little child we won&#x27;t argue among ourselves We&#x27;ll remember poor Tiny Tim  and love each other</p>
<p>We will  father  they all cried again</p>
<p>I am very happy  said Bob  I am very happy  mrs Cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young Cratchits kissed him  and he and Peter shook hands Tiny Tim your goodness lives on in your family</p>
<p>Spirit  said Scrooge  I know that you will leave me soon Tell me who that dead man on the bed was</p>
<p>No answer came in words  but the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come took Scrooge through the streets of London again</p>
<p>Wait a moment  said Scrooge  We&#x27;re passing my office Let me see how I shall look in the future</p>
<p>The spirit stopped Its hand was pointing away from the office But Scrooge hurried up to the window and looked in It was an office still  but not his The furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself The ghost continued to point onwards and Scrooge followed They reached a church  and entered the churchyard Here  among the untidy graves and the uncut grass lay the miserable man whose name Scrooge would soon learn It was a lonely place  most suitable for a man so unloved</p>
<p>The spirit stood and pointed down at one of the graves</p>
<p>Scrooge was strangely afraid</p>
<p>Before I look more closely at that gravestone  he said   answer me one question Are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they only shadows of the things that may be</p>
<p>Without replying  the ghost pointed silently down at the grave Scrooge moved slowly towards it and following the finger read on the stone his own name  EBENEZER SCROOGE</p>
<p>Am I that man who was lying on the bed  he cried</p>
<p>The spirit pointed from the grave to him and back again</p>
<p>No spirit  Oh  no no</p>
<p>The finger was still there</p>
<p>Scrooge fell to the ground in front of the ghost holding its long dark robe  Spirit Listen I am a changed man  I have learnt my lesson from you spirits Why show me this terrible end if there is no hope for me</p>
<p>For the first time the hand appeared to shake</p>
<p>Good spirit tell me that my future will change if I change my life now</p>
<p>The kind hand shook again</p>
<p>I will remember the past and think of the future I will be good to other people I will keep Christmas in my heart and will try to be kind ad cheerful and merry every day Oh tell me I can clean away the writing on this stone</p>
<p>Wildly he caught the ghostly hand and held it for a moment But the spirit was stronger than him  and pulled its hand away Just then Scrooge noticed that something strange was happening to the spirit It was getting smaller and smaller  and suddenly it became a bedpost</p>
<p>5  The end of the story</p>
<p>Yes and the bedpost was his own The bed was his own the room was his own Best and happiest of all  the future was his own  to change his life in</p>
<p>I will remember the past and think of the future  repeated Scrooge as he jumped out of bed  God bless you Jacob Marley And God bless Christmas</p>
<p>In his excitement he found it difficult to speak His face was still wet from crying  Here are my bed curtains  he cried delightedly  They aren&#x27;t stolen  And I&#x27;m alive Those were only shadows of things that may be The future will be different I know it will</p>
<p>All this time his hands were busy hurriedly putting on his clothes He put his left foot in his right shoe couldn&#x27;t find the buttons on his shirt and forgot to brush his hair</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing  said Scrooge  laughing and crying at the same time  A merry Christmas to everybody A happy new year to all the world Hurrah  There&#x27;s the door which Jacob&#x27;s ghost came through There&#x27;s the corner where the ghost of Christmas Present sat There&#x27;s the window where I saw the travelling ghosts It&#x27;s all true it all happened Ha ha ha</p>
<p>Really for a man who hadn&#x27;t laughed for so many years it was an excellent laugh The father of a long line of excellent laughs</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what day of the month it is  said Scrooge  I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ve been with the spirits I don&#x27;t know anything I&#x27;m just like a baby Never mind I prefer being a baby Hurrah</p>
<p>Just then he heard the church bells ring out louder than he had ever heard before Running to the window  he opened it and looked out No fog at all  a clear  bright  cold day  golden sunlight  blue sky sweet clean air merry bells Oh  wonderful wonderful</p>
<p>What&#x27;s today  he cried calling down to a boy in the street</p>
<p>Today  replied the boy in great surprise  Why it&#x27;s Christmas Day</p>
<p>So I haven&#x27;t missed it  thought Scrooge  The spirits have done it all in one night  He called down to the boy again  Hallo  young man Do you know the meat shop at the corner of the next street</p>
<p>Of course I do  replied the boy</p>
<p>What an intelligent boy  said Scrooge  Do you know if they&#x27;ve sold the big turkey that was in the shop window yesterday</p>
<p>What the one as big as me  asked the boy</p>
<p>What a delightful boy  said Scrooge  It&#x27;s wonderful talking to him Yes  that&#x27;s the one</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still there in the window  said the boy</p>
<p>Is it  said Scrooge  Well  go and buy it</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t mean it  cried the by</p>
<p>I do I do I&#x27;m serious Go and buy it and tell the man to bring it back here Come back with the man and I&#x27;ll give you a shilling Come back in less than five minutes and I&#x27;ll give you three shillings</p>
<p>The by went off like a bullet from a gun</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll send the turkey to Bob Cratchit&#x27;s  laughed Scrooge  He&#x27;ll never know who&#x27;s sent it It&#x27;s twice as big as Tiny Tim Ha ha ha</p>
<p>He went on laughing as he wrote Bob&#x27;s address gave it to the man with the turkey and paid for a taxi because the turkey was much too heavy to carry all the way to Camden Town</p>
<p>Now he finished dressing and went out into the streets  wearing his best clothes The town was full of happy  busy people and Scrooge smiled at all of them Three or four men said cheerfully to him   Good morning sir  And a merry Christmas to you  scrooge thought these were the best sounds that he had ever heard</p>
<p>As he was walking  he suddenly noticed one of the comfortable-looking gentlemen who had come to his office to ask for money for the poor Scrooge went straight up to him  took the old gentleman by both hands and said  My dear sir how are you  A merry Christmas to you  sir</p>
<p>Mr Scrooge  asked the gentleman surprised</p>
<p>Yes  that&#x27;s my name I&#x27;m very sorry for what I said to you when you visited me yesterday Will you please  and he spoke very quietly in the gentleman&#x27;s ear</p>
<p>Good Heavens  cried the gentleman  My dear Mr Scrooge are you serious</p>
<p>I am Not a shilling less I must tell you I haven&#x27;t given anything to anyone for years</p>
<p>My dear sir  said the gentleman shaking hands with him  I don&#x27;t know how to thank you for</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t say anything please  replied Scrooge  Will you come and see me tomorrow about it</p>
<p>I will  cried the old gentleman happily</p>
<p>Thank you and God bless you  said Scrooge</p>
<p>He went to church  and watched the people and gave children money for sweets  and discovered that he had never been so happy in his life In the afternoon he went to his nephew&#x27;s house He passed the door several times before he was brave enough to knock But at last he did it and was taken into the sitting-room where Fred and his pretty wife were waiting for their friends to arrive for dinner</p>
<p>Fred  said Scrooge  It&#x27;s your uncle Scrooge I&#x27;ve come to dinner Will you let me stay  Fred</p>
<p>Let him stay Fred almost shook his uncle&#x27;s arm off Scrooge felt at home in five minutes Nothing could be merrier And what a wonderful dinner they had Wonderful party wonderful games wonderful happiness</p>
<p>But he was early at the office next morning Oh he was there early He wanted to catch Bob Cratchit arriving late And he did The clock struck nine No Bob A quarter past No Bob He was eighteen and a half minutes late when he finally hurried in Scrooge was sitting with his office door open</p>
<p>Hallo  said Scrooge in his old hard voice  What do you mean by coming here so late</p>
<p>I&#x27;m very sorry sir  said Bob  I am late It&#x27;s only once a year We were rather merry yesterday sir</p>
<p>Now I&#x27;ll tell you what my friend said Scrooge  I&#x27;m not going to have this any longer And so  he continued  jumping off his chair and shaking Bob&#x27;s hand  I&#x27;m going to pay you twice as much</p>
<p>Bob&#x27;s face went white For a second or two he thought that Scrooge had gone crazy</p>
<p>A merry Christmas Bob  said Scrooge and it was clear that he meant It  A merrier Christmas Bob than I&#x27;ve given you for a long time I&#x27;m going to pay you well and help you with your family and we&#x27;ll discuss it all this afternoon over a Christmas drink  Bob  Put more wood on the fire at once  Bob Cratchit and let&#x27;s be comfortable</p>
<p>Scrooge did everything that he had promised and more To Tiny Tim  who did NOT die he became a second father He became as good a friend employer and man  as anyone in London or in the world Some people laughed to see the change in him but he did not care His own heart laughed inside him and that was good enough for him He never had any more conversations with spirits  but kept Christmas cheerfully and lived a happy life That is what all of us want  and so as Tiny Tim said  God bless us  every one</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row
