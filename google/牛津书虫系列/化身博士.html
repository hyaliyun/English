<p>Mr Utterson the lawyer was a quiet  serious man  Hewas shy with strangers and afraid of showing his feelings  Among friends  however  his eyes shone with kindnessand goodness And  although this goodness never found itsway into his conversation  it showed itself in his way of life He did not allow himself many enjoyable things in life  He ateand drank simply and  although he enjoyed the theatre hehad not been to a play for twenty years  However  he wasgentler towards other men  s weaknesses and was alwaysready to help rather than blame them  As a lawyer  he was often the last good person that evil-doers met on their way toprison or worse  These people often carried with them memories of his politeness and fairness</p>
<p>Mr Utterson&#x27;s best friend was a distant cousin calledRichard Enfield who was well known as a fun-loving  manabout town  Nobody could understand why they werefriends  as they were different from each other in every way They often took long walks together however  marchingthrough the streets of London in companionable silence</p>
<p>One of these walks used to take them down a narrow sidestreet in a busy part of London  It was a clean  busy  friendlystreet with bright little shops and shiny doorknockers  Nearthe end of this street  however  stood a dark  mysterious windowless building The door had neither bell nor knockerand looked dusty and uncared for  Dirty children played fearlessly on the doorstep  and nobody ever opened the door todrive them away</p>
<p>One day as Mr Enfield and his friend passed the building Mr Enfield pointed to it</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that place  he asked  It remindsme of a very strange story</p>
<p>Really  said Mr Utterson  Tell me</p>
<p>Well  began Enfield  I was coming home about threeo clock on a black winter morning when suddenly I saw twopeople The first was a short man who was walking along thestreet and the second was a little girl who was running as fastas she could  Well the two bumped into each other and thechild fell down Then a terrible thing happened The mancalmly walked all over the child&#x27;s body with his heavy boots and left her screaming on the ground It was an inhuman thingto do I ran after the man  caught him and fetched him back There was already a small crowd around the screaming child The man was perfectly cool  but he gave me a very evil look which made me feel sick in my stomach The child&#x27;s familythen arrived  and also a doctor  The child had been sent tofetch the doctor for a sick neighbour and was on her wayhome again</p>
<p>The child is more frightened than hurt  said thedoctor and that  you would think  was the end of the story But  you see I had taken a violent dislike to the short man So had the child&#x27;s family that was only natural But the doctor  who seemed a quiet  kindly man  was also looking at ourprisoner with murder in his eyes</p>
<p>The doctor and I understood each other perfectly Together we shouted at the man  and told him we would tell this story all over London so that his name would be hated</p>
<p>He looked back at us with a proud blach look  Nameyour price  he said</p>
<p>We made him agree to a hundred pounds for the child  sfamily  With another black look  the man led us to that doorover there He took out a key and let himself into thebuilding Presently he came out and handed us ten pounds ingold and a cheque for ninety pounds from Coutts&#x27;s Bank  Thename on the cheque was a well-known one</p>
<p>See here  said the doctor doubtfully  it isn&#x27;t usual for aman to walk into an empty house at four in the morning andcome out with another man&#x27;s cheque for nearly a hundredpounds</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry  said the man with an ugly look  I&#x27;ll staywith you until the banks open and</p>
<p>change the chequemyself</p>
<p>So we all went off  the doctor and the prisoner and myself and spent the rest of the night at my house In the morningwe went together to the bank  Sure enough  the cheque wasgood  and the money was passed to the child&#x27;s family</p>
<p>Well well  said Mr Utterson</p>
<p>Yes  said Enfield  it&#x27;s a strange story My prisoner wasclearly a hard  cruel man  But the man whose name was onthe cheque was well known all over London for his kind andgenerous acts Why would a man like that give his cheque to acriminal</p>
<p>And you don&#x27;t know if the writer of the cheque lives inthat building  asked Mr Utterson</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like to ask  said his friend  In my experience it&#x27;s not a good idea to ask too many questions in case the answers are ugly violent ones But I&#x27;ve studied the place alittle It doesn&#x27;t seem like a house  There&#x27;s no other door and the only person who uses that door is the man I&#x27;ve just described to you There are three windows on the side of thehouse which look down onto a small courtyard The windowsare shut but they&#x27;re always clean There&#x27;s a chimney too which is usually smoking So somebody must live there</p>
<p>The two men continued on their walk  Then Utterson brokethe silence</p>
<p>Enfield  he said  you&#x27;re right about not asking toomany questions However I want to ask the name of the manwho walked over the child</p>
<p>Very well   said Enfield  He told us his name wasHyde</p>
<p>What does he look like</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not easy to describe  although I remember him perfectly He&#x27;s a strange-looking man He&#x27;s short but has astrong  heavy body There&#x27;s something wrong with his appearance something ugly and unpleasing no somethinghateful I disliked him at once</p>
<p>Mr Utterson thought deeply  Are you sure he used a key  he asked</p>
<p>What do you mean  asked Enfield in surprise</p>
<p>I know it must seem strange  said his friend  But yousee  if I don&#x27;t ask you the name on the cheque  it&#x27;s because Iknow it already</p>
<p>Well  why didn&#x27;t you tell me  said his friend rathercrossly  Anyway  he did have a key  and he still has it  Isaw him use it only a week ago</p>
<p>Mr Utterson looked at him thoughtfully but said nothingmore</p>
<p>2  In search of Mr Hyde</p>
<p>After dinner that evening Mr Utterson went into his office and unlocked a cupboard  He took out an envelope It contained the will of Doctor Henry Jekyll and was writtenin the doctor&#x27;s own handwriting</p>
<p>If I die or if I disappear for more than three months  thewill began  I wish to leave everything I own to my dearfriend Edward Hyde</p>
<p>This will had both worried and annoyed Mr Utterson  To alawyer it was an unusual and dangerous kind of will  It wasbad enough when Edward Hyde was only an unknown name but now that the lawyer knew something about Hyde  the willworried him more than ever  It had seemed like madness before now it began to seem shameful  With a heavy heart MrUtterson replaced the envelope in the cupboard put on hiscoat and went to see his old friend Doctor Lanyon</p>
<p>Doctor Lanyon was enjoying his after-dinner coffee  Comein old friend   he cried  The two men had known each othersince their school days They sat for several minutes drinkingcoffee and talking companionably of this and that  At last MrUtterson mentioned the thoughts that were worrying him</p>
<p>I suppose Lanyon  he said  that you and I are HenryJekyll&#x27;s oldest friends</p>
<p>I suppose so  said Doctor Lanyon  but I don&#x27;t often seehim now</p>
<p>Really   said Mr Utterson in surprise  I thought you andhe were interested in the same things</p>
<p>We were at one time  said Doctor Lanyon  But morethan ten years ago Henry Jekyll became too well imaginativefor me  He developed some strange wild  unscientific ideas  Itold him so and I&#x27;ve seen very little of him since then</p>
<p>Mr Utterson looked at his friend&#x27;s red  angry face  Only adisagreement about some scientific question  he thought  It&#x27;s nothing worse than that   Calmly he continued  Didyou ever meet a friend of Jekyll&#x27;s a man called Hyde</p>
<p>Hyde  repeated Lanyon  No  never</p>
<p>Soon the lawyer said goodnight and went home to bed where he lay awake for a long time thinking about Enfield&#x27;s description of Hyde and Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s will When at last hefell asleep he was troubled by dreams  In his mind&#x27;s eye hesaw a faceless man marching over the child&#x27;s body Then hesaw his old friend Jekyll in bed while the same faceless figurestood over him The facelessness of that figure worried himdeeply</p>
<p>Very well Mr Hyde  said the lawyer to himself  I willfind you and I will see your face for myself</p>
<p>During the next few weeks Mr Utterson spent many hoursin the narrow street where Enfield had seen Hyde He waitedpatiently near the mysterious door  hoping for a sight of MrHyde and one dry  clear winter night he was successful The street was empty and silent and small sounds carried along way The lawyer heard footsteps  He stepped back intothe shadows and waited A short figure turned the corner andwalked towards the mysterious door  Although Mr Uttersoncould not see his face  he felt a strong  almost violent  dislikefor the stranger</p>
<p>Mr Utterson stepped forward and touched him on the shoulder  Mr Hyde</p>
<p>Yes that&#x27;s my name  said the stranger coolly   What doyou want</p>
<p>I see that you&#x27;re going in I&#x27;m an old friend of DoctorJekyll&#x27;s My name is Utterson You must have heard myname may I come in with you</p>
<p>Doctor Jekyll is not at home  replied Mr Hyde  How didyou know me  he added sharply</p>
<p>First let me see your face  replied the lawyer</p>
<p>Mr Hyde hesitated for a moment  then he stood under thestreet light and the lawyer saw his face  Thank you   saidMr Utterson  Now I shall know you again  It may beuseful</p>
<p>Yes  said Mr Hyde  it may indeed be useful Here too is my address You may need it one day  He gave the lawyerhis address which was in a poor part of London</p>
<p>Good God  thought the lawyer  does Hyde know aboutJekyll&#x27;s will Is that what he&#x27;s thinking of  But he saidnothing</p>
<p>And now  said Mr Hyde  How did you know me</p>
<p>You were described to me</p>
<p>Who did that</p>
<p>I know people who know you</p>
<p>Who   asked Mr Hyde sharply</p>
<p>Doctor Jekyll for example  said the lawyer</p>
<p>He never told you  cried Mr Hyde in sudden anger  Don&#x27;t lie to me  And before the lawyer could answer  heturned the key in the lock and disappeared into the house</p>
<p>Mr Utterson stared at the closed door  Why do I dislikehim so much  he said to himself  Enfield was right thereis something evil about the man Poor Henry Jekyll I&#x27;m worried about you  Your new friend will mean trouble for you</p>
<p>Round the corner from the narrow street there was a squareof handsome old houses One of these was Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s house and Mr Utterson knocked at the front door  The servant answered and told him that Doctor Jekyll was not athome</p>
<p>I saw Mr Hyde go in by the laboratory door in the street atthe back of the house  said the lawyer</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right Mr Utterson  replied the servant   MrHyde has his own key  and comes and goes when he likes  Wehave orders from Doctor Jekyll to obey him</p>
<p>Mr Utterson walked home more worried than ever</p>
<p>A fortnight later Doctor Jekyll gave a dinner party for a fewold friends Mr Utterson was among them and he remained after the others had left</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been wanting to speak to you for some time Jekyll  said the lawyer  about your will</p>
<p>Doctor Jekyll was a tall  well made man of fifty with asmooth  kindly face  My poor friend  he said  you doworry unnecessarily  you know  Like poor Lanyon when Itold him about my new ideas  Imaginative rubbish he calledthem  I&#x27;m very disappointed in Lanyon</p>
<p>But the lawyer did not want to talk about Doctor Lanyon  You know I&#x27;ve never agreed with your will  he continued  You&#x27;ve told me often enough  said his friend sharply</p>
<p>Well I&#x27;ve learnt something about your friend Hyde  continued the lawyer</p>
<p>The colour of the doctor&#x27;s handsome face changed from pinkto greyish-white  I don&#x27;t want to hear any more  he said  You don&#x27;t understand  I&#x27;m in a very difficult painful situation</p>
<p>Tell me everything  said Mr Utterson  and I&#x27;ll do mybest to help you</p>
<p>You&#x27;re very kind but this is a private matter I&#x27;ll tell youone thing I can get rid of Mr Hyde any time I want  Youmust understand however  that I take a great interest in poorHyde I know you&#x27;ve seen him he told me  and I&#x27;m afraidhe wasn&#x27;t very polite to you  But I really do care about him And if anything happens to me I want you to promise tomake sure that he inherits my money</p>
<p>I cannot pretend that I shall ever like him   said thelawyer</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not asking you to like him  said his friend  I onlyask you to help him when I&#x27;m gone</p>
<p>I promise  said Mr Utterson sadly</p>
<p>3  The Carew murder</p>
<p>One night in London nearly a year later  a servant girlwas sitting at her bedroom window  looking out at themoonlit street  She saw a tall  handsome old man with whitehair coming along the street and a shorter younger manwalkingtowardshim The old man spoke politely to theyounger one  He seemed  the girl said later  to be asking hisway  Then the girl looked more closely at the younger manand recognized him</p>
<p>It was Mr Hyde   she said later  He once visited my master</p>
<p>Mr Hyde  the girl said  was carrying a heavy stick  He wasplaying with it impatiently as he listened to the old man  Thensuddenly he seemed to explode with anger</p>
<p>He was like a madman  the servant girl said   He shookhis stick at the old man who stepped back in surprise  Thenhe hit the old man violently with the stick and knocked him tothe ground  He beat the helpless body again and again  I couldhear the bones breaking  It was so terrible that I began tofeel ill Then everything went black and I don&#x27;t remember anymore</p>
<p>It was two o clock in the morning before she was consciousagain  and able to call the police  The murderer had disappeared but the dead man was still lying on the ground withthe murder weapon beside him The stick had broken in themiddle  and one half still lay beside the murdered man  Thepolice decided that the murderer had carried away the otherhalf A gold watch and a purse were found in the dead man spockets  but no cards or papers  except a letter addressed toMr Utterson</p>
<p>A policeman brought this letter to the lawyer the nextmorning Together they drove to the police station where thebody had been taken</p>
<p>A police inspector showed him the body</p>
<p>Yes I recognize him  said Mr Utterson heavily  He isSir Danvers Carew</p>
<p>Thank you  sir  said the inspector  And do you recognizethis   He showed Mr Utterson the broken stick and told himthe servant girl s story</p>
<p>Mr Utterson knew the stick at once  That s HenryJekyll s stick  he said to himself  I gave it to him long ago</p>
<p>Is this Hyde a short  evil looking man  he asked</p>
<p>That s how the servant girl described him  sir  agreed theinspector</p>
<p>Come with me  said Mr Utterson to the inspector  Ithink I know where he lives</p>
<p>Mr Utterson led him to the address on Mr Hyde  s visitingcard It was in a poor part of London in a dirty street full ofcheap bars and eating houses  This was the home of HenryJekyll s favourite friend the man who would inherit Jekyll squarter of a million pounds</p>
<p>An old servant opened the door Under her silvery hair wasa smooth face with a false smile and evil eyes  but she was polite enough</p>
<p>Yes  she said  Mr Hyde lives here But he s not athome  My master came in very late last night He left againafter only an hour</p>
<p>Was that unusual  asked the inspector</p>
<p>Not at all  replied the servant  He s often away andfrequently stays away for months at a time</p>
<p>We would like to see his flat  said Mr Utterson</p>
<p>Oh I can&#x27;t do that sir  began the servant</p>
<p>This gentleman is a police inspector  said Mr Utterson</p>
<p>Ah   said the servant looking unnaturally pleased aboutit   Mr Hyde s in trouble What s he done</p>
<p>Mr Utterson and the inspector looked at each other  Hedoesn&#x27;t seem a very popular person  said the inspector Heturned to the servant  Now please let us in and we&#x27;ll have alook around</p>
<p>Mr Hyde had only two rooms in the house These were extremely comfortable and in excellent taste with beautiful pictures on the walls and rich carpets on the floor Everythingwas wildly untidy however and the fireplace was full of halfburnt papers  Among these the detective found part of acheque book He also found the other half of the murderweapon</p>
<p>Excellent  he said  Now let s visit the bank and see ifthey recognize this cheque book</p>
<p>Sure enough  the bank held several thousand pounds in anaccount in the name of Edward Hyde</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got him now  sir  said the inspector  We&#x27;ve gotthe murder weapon and we&#x27;ve got his cheque book  Now weonly need his description on the Wanted notices</p>
<p>This was not so easy  There were no photographs of thewanted man and no two people could agree about his appearance They all agreed on one thing  however  An evil man sir  the servant girl said  You could see it in his face</p>
<p>4  Doctor Jekyll receives a letter</p>
<p>Later that same afternoon Mr Utterson found his way toDoctor Jekyll s house Jekyll s servant  Poole  let himin at once and took him through the kitchen and across theback garden to the laboratory behind the house It was thefirst time that Mr Utterson had seen his friend s laboratory and he looked around curiously</p>
<p>The old servant led Mr Utterson through the laboratory andup some stairs to the doctor s private study above This was alarge room with tall  glass fronted cupboards  a large mirrorand a big businesslike table A good fire burned in the fireplace and beside it sat Doctor Jekyll  looking white and ill  Ina thin  tired voice he welcomed his friend</p>
<p>Have you heard the news  said Mr Utterson after the oldservant had left</p>
<p>The newsboys were shouting about it in the street  DoctorJekyll said  A terrible business</p>
<p>Let me ask you something  said the lawyer  Sir DanversCarew was my client  but you are my client too and I want toknow what I&#x27;m doing You haven&#x27;t tried to hide the murderer  have you</p>
<p>Utterson I promise you  cried the doctor  I promise youI&#x27;ll never see him again  I&#x27;ve finished with him for ever  Andnow  indeed  he no longer needs my help You don&#x27;t knowhim like I do  He s safe  quite safe Believe me nobody willever hear of Hyde again</p>
<p>The lawyer listened with a serious face  He did not like hisfriend s feverish  excited look</p>
<p>You seem very sure of him  he replied  I hope you reright If he is caught and comes to trial your name may bementioned</p>
<p>I&#x27;m absolutely sure of him   answered Jekyll   I can&#x27;t tellyou how I know</p>
<p>but I&#x27;m certain  But can you please adviseme about one thing I&#x27;ve received a letter and I don&#x27;t knowwhether to show it to the police May I leave it in your hands Utterson</p>
<p>You&#x27;re afraid I suppose  that the letter will lead the police to Hyde  asked the lawyer</p>
<p>No  said Doctor Jekyll  I don&#x27;t care what happens toHyde I was thinking of my own reputation  Anyway here is the letter</p>
<p>It was written in a strange pointed handwriting and signed Edward Hyde   I am sorry that I have been so ungrateful inthe past for your many generous acts  it began  Please don&#x27;t worry about me I am quite safe and I am certain that I can escape unharmed whenever I wish</p>
<p>Did this letter come by post  asked the lawyer</p>
<p>No  replied Doctor Jekyll  There was no postmark on theenvelope The letter came by hand</p>
<p>Shall I keep the letter and think about it  asked Mr Utterson</p>
<p>I want you to decide for me  answered his client  I  mnot sure of anything any more</p>
<p>Very well  said the lawyer  Now tell me the part inyour will about disappearing for three months or more  Wasthat Hyde s idea</p>
<p>It was  whispered Doctor Jekyll</p>
<p>He was planning to murder you  said the lawyer  You&#x27;ve had a lucky escape</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had a lesson too  said his client  in pain and sadness  Oh  what a lesson   And he covered his face with his hands</p>
<p>On his way ont of the house  the lawyer stopped and spoketo Poole</p>
<p>By the way  he said   a letter was handed in today foryour master  Who brought it  and what did he look like</p>
<p>Nobody came except the postman  sir  said the servant insurprise</p>
<p>That worries me  thought Mr Utterson as he walkedhome  Clearly the letter arrived by the laboratory door  perhaps it was even written in the study  I must think about thiscarefully</p>
<p>In the street the newsboys were still shouting  Read allabout it Terrible murder</p>
<p>The lawyer s thoughts were sad  One of his clients wasdead and the life and reputation of another were in danger Mr Utterson did not</p>
<p>usually ask anyone for advice  Today however was different</p>
<p>That evening he sat by his fireside with his chief clerk  MrGuest beside him The lawyer and his clerk had worked together for many years  and knew and understood each other Also  Mr Guest had been involved in business with DoctorJekyll and knew him well</p>
<p>Outside it was foggy and dark but the room was bright andwarm and there was a bottle of good whisky on the table</p>
<p>This is a sad business about Sir Danvers Carew  said MrUtterson</p>
<p>Yes indeed sir The murderer was a madman of course</p>
<p>I would like your opinion about that  replied the lawyer  I have a letter from the murderer here</p>
<p>Mr Guest was interested in the study of handwriting  Hiseyes brightened at once  A murderer s letter   he said  That will be interesting  He looked carefully at the writing  Not a madman  I think  he said  But what unusual handwriting</p>
<p>Just then a servant entered with a note</p>
<p>Is that note from Doctor Jekyll   asked Mr Guest  Ithought I recognized the handwriting Is it anything private Mr Utterson</p>
<p>Only an invitation to dinner Why Do you want to seethe letter</p>
<p>Just for a moment please sir  The clerk put the two letters side by side and studied them carefully  Thank you sir  he said  Very interesting</p>
<p>For a moment Mr Utterson hesitated wondering and worrying At last he put his thoughts into words  Why did youlook at the two letters together  he asked</p>
<p>Well sir in many ways the two are surprisingly similar</p>
<p>How strange  Mr Guest I must ask you not to speakof this business to anyone</p>
<p>Of course not sir  said the clerk  You can depend onme  Shortly afterwards he said good night to his master andmade his way home</p>
<p>When he was alone Mr Utterson locked the two letters inhis cupboard  Well  he thought  So Henry Jekyll wrotethat letter for a murderer  His face was as calm and expressionless as usual but his heart was filled with fear for his oldfriend</p>
<p>5  The death of a friend</p>
<p>Time passed The search for Mr Hyde continued SirDanvers Carew was an important and popular man andthe police tried desperately to arrest the murderer and bringhim to trial But there was no sign of Mr Hyde himself  although the police and the newspapers discovered a lot about hispast life Nobody it seemed could say one good word aboutthe wanted man  He was a cruel  violent man  who had livedan evil life full of hate and jealousy None of this  however was any help to the police  Mr Hyde had just disappeared</p>
<p>As time went by  Mr Utterson became calmer and more atpeace with himself  He was truly sorry that his client  SirDanvers Carew  was dead  but he was also very glad that MrHyde had disappeared  As for Doctor Jekyll  he too appearedcalmer and happier He came out into the world again He invited friends to his house and accepted invitations to theirs  Hehad always been a good and generous man Now however hebecame a churchgoer too  He was busy  he spent a lot of timein the fresh air and he looked happy and carefree For morethan two months he was at peace with himself and the world</p>
<p>On the 8th of January Mr Utterson was invited to dinner atDoctor Jekyll s house Doctor Lanyon was there too  This isquite like old times  thought the lawyer as he watched DoctorJekyll smiling at Doctor Lanyon</p>
<p>On January 12th however and again on the 14th  DoctorJekyll refused to see visitors</p>
<p>The doctor is not well  explained Poole  He hopes youwill forgive him but he cannot see anyone</p>
<p>Mr Utterson called again next day  and again the day afterthat After two months of almost daily meetings with his oldfriend the lawyer felt rather lonely On the sixth evening heinvited his clerk Mr Guest to dinner with him  and on theseventh night he went to visit Doctor Lanyon</p>
<p>Doctor Lanyon made him welcome but Mr Utterson wasshocked by the change in the doctor s appearance His face which was usually pink and healthy  was grey and thin  andthere was a frightened look in his eyes  He was suddenly anold sick man</p>
<p>He looks  said Mr Utterson to himself  like a man whoknows he s dying</p>
<p>How are you Lanyon  he said  You don&#x27;t look well</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had a shock Utterson  replied Doctor Lanyon  Andit will cause my death I have only a few weeks to live  Hepaused  Well it comes to us all sooner or later  I&#x27;ve had agood life  on the whole</p>
<p>Jekyll is ill too  said the lawyer  Have you seen him</p>
<p>At the name of Jekyll the look on Doctor Lanyon s face changed  Please  he said  holding up a trembling hand  don&#x27;t speak that name in this house</p>
<p>Oh dear  said Mr Utterson He hesitated for a moment  The three of us have been friends all our lives Lanyon Weare too old now to make new friends Can&#x27;t you forgive andforget Perhaps I can help</p>
<p>Nothing can be done  replied Doctor Lanyon  Ask himyourself</p>
<p>He won&#x27;t let me into the house</p>
<p>That doesn&#x27;t surprise me  One day Utterson  after I amdead you will perhaps learn the full story  Meanwhile  if youcan sit and talk to me of other things  please stay  Just don&#x27;t mention that person  as it hurts me to think about him</p>
<p>As soon as he got home  Mr Utterson wrote to DoctorJekyll In his letter he asked why Jekyll refused to let him intohis house and why he and Doctor Lanyon were no longerfriendly The reply was long and not always easy to understand</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not angry with our old friend  Doctor Jekyll wrote  but I agree with him that the two of us must never meetagain Meanwhile you must forgive me if from now on I livea very quiet life  If you find my door closed to you it&#x27;s because I must travel this dark dangerous road alone  I havedone wrong and I&#x27;m being punished for it and nobody canhelp me</p>
<p>What is this  thought Mr Utterson  Hyde has disappeared Jekyll is his normal self again at least he was untillast week  Has he gone mad  Then he remembered DoctorLanyon&#x27;s words  There is something more  he said to himself  something mysterious  but I have no idea what it is</p>
<p>A week later Doctor Lanyon was too ill to leave his bed Two weeks after that he was dead  After his friend&#x27;s burial Mr Utterson went home and into his office From his lockedcupboard he took out an envelope  which he had received soonafter his friend  s death</p>
<p>In Doctor Lanyon&#x27;s handwriting he read  G J Utterson Private  The lawyer turned the envelope over and over in hishands before he opened it What terrible news could itcontain  With trembling hands Mr Utterson opened the envelope  Inside was another envelope  with the words Not to beopened until the death or disappearance of Doctor HenryJekyll</p>
<p>The lawyer could not believe his eyes  Death or disappearance   the words were the same as in Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s will  Iunderstand why Jekyll wrote those words  said Mr Uttersonto himself  But why did Lanyon write them too  For a moment he wanted to open the envelope and uncover the mysterythere and then  But Mr Utterson was too honest a man and alawyer to do that  He knew he must obey his friend&#x27;s andclient&#x27;s last wish  He locked the envelope away in his cupboard beside Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s will</p>
<p>The lawyer was desperately worried about his friend DoctorJekyll  He was afraid for him too  He called at the house butthe doctor always refused to see him</p>
<p>How is he Poole  Mr Utterson asked the old servant oneday</p>
<p>Not very well sir He spends all his time in the studyabove his laboratory He sleeps there as well  He seems verysilent and uneasy  Something is worrying him  sir</p>
<p>but hewon&#x27;t tell anyone</p>
<p>For a long time the lawyer called almost every day  Little bylittle however  he became tired of his friend&#x27;s refusal to seehim  and his visits became less frequent</p>
<p>6  The face at the window</p>
<p>One Sunday soon afterwards Mr Utterson was walkingwith his friend Enfield when they happened to passthrough the narrow side-street again  Enfleld pointed to themysterious door</p>
<p>Well  he said  that story is finished We shall never seeMr Hyde again</p>
<p>I hope you&#x27;re right  said the lawyer  Did I tell you  Ionce saw Hyde too and had the same strong feelings of dislikefor him as you did What an evil man</p>
<p>I agree  said his friend  By the way  why didn&#x27;t you tellme that our mysterious door led to the laboratory at the back ofDoctor Jekyll&#x27;s house I didn&#x27;t know then but I know now</p>
<p>Well now that you know let&#x27;s go into the courtyard andlook up at his window I must tell you  I&#x27;m worried aboutpoor Jekyll Perhaps the sight of a friendly face will do himgood</p>
<p>Overhead the evening sky was bright but the courtyard wascool and dark At an open window of the study above the laboratory  Doctor Jekyll sat  like a prisoner staring at the worldoutside</p>
<p>I hope you are better Jekyll  the lawyer called up to him</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head sadly  I&#x27;m not well Utterson  he said  I shall not be here much longer thankGod</p>
<p>You spend too much time indoors You ought to get outinto the fresh air like Enfield and me  By the way  this ismy cousin  Mr Enfield  COme now-get your hat and join usfor a quick walk</p>
<p>You &#x27;re very kind  said the doctor  But no  it&#x27;s quiteimpossible  I would like to invite you and Mr Enfield inside but the place is not very tidy</p>
<p>Well then  said the lawyer gently  we can talk to youfrom here</p>
<p>That&#x27;s an excellent idea- began the doctor with asmile But suddenly the smile left his face and was replaced byan expression of hopelessness  fear and horror  The two menbelow saw it but only for a second  as the window was shutwith a bang  The two men looked at each other  then turnedand left the courtyard without a word In silence they crossedthe narrow side-street They did not speak until they came outinto a busy  noisy street  Then Mr Utterson at last turned andlooked at his companion  whose face was as pale as his own The expression on Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s face had upset them bothdeeply</p>
<p>God help him  whispered Mr Utterson  God help thepoor man</p>
<p>But Mr Enfield only nodded his head very seriously andwalked on without a word</p>
<p>7  The last night</p>
<p>It was now March  and Mr Utterson was sitting by thefire after dinner when he was surprised to receive avisitfrom Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s servant Poole The old man looked paleand frightened</p>
<p>Mr Utterson he said  something is wrong</p>
<p>Sit down by the fire and tell me all abut it</p>
<p>The doctor&#x27;s locked himself up in his study  sir</p>
<p>That&#x27;s quite usual  surely   said the lawyer   You knowyour master&#x27;s habits as well as I do He often shuts himselfaway from the world</p>
<p>Yes but this time it&#x27;s different  It frightens me  sirI&#x27;ve been frightened for more than a week now  and I justcan&#x27;t go on any longer</p>
<p>He stopped and stared down at the floor</p>
<p>Try and tell me  Poole  said Mr Utterson gently   Something terrible is happening to my master I can&#x27;t explain  But  please sir can you come with me and see foryourself</p>
<p>At once Mr Utterson fetched his coat and hat</p>
<p>Thank you  sir  whispered Poole gratefully</p>
<p>Together they made their way to Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s house  Itwas a wild stormy night To Mr Utterson the streets seemedstrangely empty and lonely  The square  when they reachedit  was full of wind and flying dust  The thin trees were blowing wildly  and untidy grey clouds were sailing past a pale sickly moon</p>
<p>Well sir  said Poole   here we are  and I hope that nothing is wrong  He knocked softly at the front door  The doorwas opened just a little and a voice from inside asked  Is thatyou Poole</p>
<p>Yes-open the door</p>
<p>The hall when they entered was brightly lit A good firewas burning The room was full of people-every servant inthe house was there They looked like a crowd of frightenedchildren</p>
<p>What&#x27;s all this  said the lawyer  What are you all doinghere  Your master would not be pleased</p>
<p>They&#x27;re frightened  said Poole simply No one elsespoke A little servant girl began to cry</p>
<p>Quiet  said Poole sharply trying to control his own fear  Now-fetch me a light and we&#x27;ll finish this business at once Mr Utterson  sir  please follow me  He led the way across theback garden towards the laboratory</p>
<p>Come as quietly as you can  sir I want you to hear  but Idon&#x27;t want him to hear you And sin if he asks you to go inside-don&#x27;t go</p>
<p>Mr Utterson&#x27;s heart gave a little jump of fear  but hebravely followed the servant into the laboratory to the bottomof the stairs</p>
<p>Wait here  sir-and listen carefully whispered Poole  Hehimself again controlling his fear  climbed the stairs andknocked on the study door</p>
<p>Mr Utterson would like to see you  sir  he called</p>
<p>Tell him I cannot see anyone   said a voice from inside theStudy</p>
<p>Thank you sir  said Poole He led Mr Utterson backacross the garden and into the house   Sir  he said   was thatmy master&#x27;s voice</p>
<p>The lawyer&#x27;s face was pale   It has changed  he said</p>
<p>Changed  You&#x27;re right  said Poole  I&#x27;ve worked forDoctof Jekyll for twenty years That was not my master&#x27;s voice Someone has murdered my master  Eight days ago weheard his voice for the last time  Dear God  he cried-thenno more The voice you heard just now was the voice of hismuderer</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary story  my good man  said Mr Utterson  He tried hard to appear calm  If Dr Jekyll has beenmurdered-why is his murderer still there  What reason couldhe possibly have for staying</p>
<p>Perhaps you don&#x27;t believe me  sir  but I know what Iheard For a week now the person-or thing-in that studyhas been crying night and day for some special chemical powders My master was in the habit when he was particularlybusy with his scientific work of writing orders on pieces ofpaper and leaving them on the stairs  We&#x27;ve had nothing elsethis week  nothing except written orders and a locked door I&#x27;ve been to every chemist in town in search of these chemicalsof his but they were never right They weren&#x27;t pure enough he said  I had to take them back to the shop and try anotherchemist I don&#x27;t know what these chemicals are but the person in that study wants them terribly badly</p>
<p>Did you keep any of these written orders  asked Mr Utterson</p>
<p>Poole reached in his pocket and brought out a note Thelawyer read it carefully It said  I am returning your chemicals as they are impure and therefore useless In the year18-you made up a mixture of chemical powders for DoctorHenry Jekyll  Please search your cupboards for some more ofthe same mixture and send it to Doctor Jekyll AT ONCE Thisis VERY IMPORTANT</p>
<p>This is a strange note  said Mr Utterson</p>
<p>The chemist thought so too   sir  said Poole  When I tookhim this note he cried  All my chemicals are pure and youcan tell your master so  and he threw the note back at me</p>
<p>Are you sure this is your master&#x27;s handwriting   asked MrUtterson</p>
<p>Of course sir  said Poole  But what does handwritingmatter  I&#x27;ve seen my master&#x27;s murderer</p>
<p>Seen him  repeated Mr Utterson</p>
<p>Yes It was like this I came suddenly into the laboratoryfrom the garden I think he had left the study to look forsomething The study door was open and there he was at thefar end of the laboratory He was searching among some oldboxes He looked up when I came in  gave a kind of cry andran upstairs and into the study I only saw him for a moment but my blood seemed to freeze Sir if that was my master why was he wearing a mask over his face  If it was my master  why did he cry out like a trapped animal and run awayfrom me  I&#x27;ve been his servant for twenty years And then   Poole paused and covered his face with his hands tooupset to speak</p>
<p>This is all very mysterious  said Mr Utterson   but I thinkI begin to understand Your master  Poole is ill And the illness has changed his appearance Perhaps that also explainsthe change in his voice It certainly explains the mask and theway he has been avoiding his friends And of course he&#x27;s searching for these chemicals he cause he believes they willmake him well again Dear God I hope he&#x27;s right PoorJekyll-thst is my explanation It&#x27;s sad enough Poole butit&#x27;s normal and natural and there&#x27;s nothing to be alarmedabout</p>
<p>Sir  said the servant  that thing was not my master My master is a tall fine well built man The stranger wasmuch shorter  Sir I have been with my master for twentyyears and I know his appearance as well as I know my own No sir that thing in the mask was never Doctor Jekyll  and Ibelieve that he-it-murdered my master</p>
<p>Poole  said the lawyer if you say that  I must makesure  We must break down the study door</p>
<p>You&#x27;re right  Mr Utterson  cried the old servant</p>
<p>Very well  Will you help me  If we are wrong  I&#x27;ll makesure that you&#x27;re not blamed for it</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an axe in the laboratory  suggested Poole</p>
<p>You realize  Poole  said Mr Utterson  that this may bedangerous for us both  Let us now be honest with each other This masked figure that you saw-you&#x27;re certain that it wasnot your master</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right  sir</p>
<p>Did you in fact recognize it</p>
<p>Well sir it was all so quick that I&#x27;m not really sure But well I think it was Mr Hyde It was short like MrHyde  and it moved in the same light  quick  active way  Andwho else could come in by the laboratory door from the street You must remember sir that at the time of the Carew murder Mr Hyde still had the laboratory key with him  But that&#x27;s not all Mr Utterson  did you ever meet Mr Hyde</p>
<p>Yes  replied the lawyer  I once spoke with him</p>
<p>Then you will know  sir that there is something strangeabout Mr Hyde something evil</p>
<p>I agree with you  said Mr Utterson  I felt something likethst  too</p>
<p>Yes sir Well when that thing in the mask jumped outfrom behind the boxes and ran up the stairs I had exactly thesame feeling That thing behind the mask was Mr Hydee</p>
<p>I understand Poole and I believe you  said the lawyerslowly  And I believe poor Henry Jekyll has been murdered I believe too that his murderer is still hiding in the study Now  Poole  let&#x27;s go and make an end of it</p>
<p>Together they went out into the back garden The cloudshad covered the moon and it was now quite dark  As theypassed silently by the wall of the laboratory  they stopped andlistened Further away they could hear the everyday noises of aLondon evening  From the study above them  however camethe sound of footsteps moving backwards and forwards acrossthe floor</p>
<p>It walks like that all day sir  whisperedPoole  yes andmost of the night too It only stops when some more chemicalsarrive from the chemist Ah  sir listen to that-do you thinkthose are my master&#x27;s footsteps</p>
<p>The short light steps were indeed very different from Henry Jekyll&#x27;s long heavy ones</p>
<p>Have you anything else to tell me Poole  asked thelawyer heavily</p>
<p>Once  said Poole  I heard it weeping</p>
<p>Weeping  repeated Mr Utterson in horror</p>
<p>Weeping like a lost child  said the old servant  It tore myheart  I felt like weeping too</p>
<p>well  said the lawyer  we have a job to do</p>
<p>They went into the laboratory and climbed the stairs to thestudy  Jekyll  called the lawyer in a loud voice  I must seeyou  He paused for a moment but there was no reply  Ifyou refuse to let me in  then I&#x27;ll break dowu the door</p>
<p>Utterson  said a voice from inside the study  I beg you toleave me alone</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not Jekyll&#x27;s voice   shied Mr Utterson   It&#x27;s Hyde&#x27;s Break the door down  Poole</p>
<p>The axe rose and fell The door shook and a scream of purefear like a trapped animal rang from the study  Again theaxe crashed against the door But the wood was strong and thelock was well made At last  however  the door fell inwardsupon the carpet</p>
<p>The two men stared into the study They saw a warm comfortable room with a good fire burning in the fireplace anda few papers on the big table  A friendly  homely room  Butface down in the middle of the floor there lay the body of aman The lawyer turned it over on its back and saw the face ofEdward Hyde  He was dressed in clothes that were much toolarge for him  and in his hand he held a small bottle</p>
<p>The lawyer shook his head  He&#x27;s taken poison  Poole  hesaid  I fear we&#x27;ve come too late to save Doctor Jekyll  andtoo late to punish his murderer too  Now we must find yourmaster&#x27;s body</p>
<p>They searched everywhere but there was no sign of HenryJekyll  dead or alive</p>
<p>Perhaps your master has escaped  said Mr Utterson hopefully  He went to check the door from the laboratory into thenarrow side street It was locked and covered with dust Onthe floor nearby he found a broken key</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a long time since anyone opened this door   said MrUtterson</p>
<p>Yes  said Poole picking up the broken key  So how didHyde get in</p>
<p>This is too difficult for me Pooh  said the lawyer  Let&#x27;sgo back to the study</p>
<p>They searched the study again  Look sir  said Poole Pointing to a small bable in the corner There were bottles ofliquid and some white powders lying in saucers  He was testing his chemicals here</p>
<p>One of the doctor&#x27;s books was lying on the floor  Its coverwas torn off The lawyer picked it up Doctor Jekyll loved hisbooks and always took great care of them  But he had writtenall over this one-the handwriting was unmistakable-beforetearing it and throwing it on the floor</p>
<p>Then the lawyer noticed the tall mirror on the wall betweenthe glass-fronted bookshelves</p>
<p>How strange  said Mr Utterson  Why did Jekyll want amirror in his study</p>
<p>Next they turned to the desk and found a large packet addressed to Mr Utterson  The handwriting was DoctorJekyll&#x27;s The lawyer opened the packet and three envelopesfell out on to the floor The first contained a will  It was likeDoctor Jekyll&#x27;s first win in every way- except one The doctor had left all his money not to Edward Hyde but to GabrielJohn Utterson</p>
<p>The lawyer looked at the will then at Poole and finally atthe dead man on the floor</p>
<p>I just don&#x27;t understand  he whispered  Hyde has beenhere all this time-why didn&#x27;t he destroy this will</p>
<p>He picked up the next envelope It contained a short note inthe doctor&#x27;s handwriting Mr Utterson saw the date  Poole  he cried  this is today&#x27;s date on the letter  Jekyllwas alive here today  He can&#x27;t be dead-he has run away or ishiding somewhere And if so  why If he&#x27;s alive can we besure that Hyde killed himself  We must be careful  Poole orwe may involve your master in some terrible danger</p>
<p>Why don&#x27;t you read the note  sir asked the servant</p>
<p>Because I&#x27;m afraid said the lawyer in a worried voice Slowly he lifted the letter and read</p>
<p>My dear Utterson</p>
<p>If you are reading this it means that I have disappeared Please go home and read Lanyon&#x27;s letter Afterwards pleaseread the confessicn of</p>
<p>Your unfortunate and unhappy friend</p>
<p>Henry Jekyll</p>
<p>This must be the confession  said Mr Utterson to himself picking up the third and largest envelope He put it in hispocket  say nothing about these papers  Poole  he said   Ifyour master has died or disappeared this paper may save hisreputation It&#x27;s now ten o clock I must go home and studythese papers in peace and quiet But I shall come back here before midnight and then we shall send fof the police</p>
<p>They went out locking the laboratory door behind them With a heavy heart Mr Utterson walked home to read his letters</p>
<p>8  Doctor Lanyon&#x27;s letter</p>
<p>Dear Utterson</p>
<p>Four days ago on the 9th of January I received a letterby the evening post it was in the handwriting of my oldfriend Henry Jekyll I was rather surprised as we were not inthe habit of writing to each other  and I had had dinner withhim the night before  When I came to read the letter  I waseven more surprised  The letter said</p>
<p>Dear Lanyon</p>
<p>You are one of my oldest friends  Although we havesometimes disagreed on scientific matters I have alwaysremained your friend  I would do anything for you  Lanyon-please will you do something for me now</p>
<p>Please  old friend come to my house at once wth thisletter in your hand Poole my servant  has his orders  Hewill be here with a locksmith Break the lock of my studydoor  and then you must go in there alone Open the glassfronted cupboard on the left hand side and look on the fourthshelf from the top On it you will find some pacKets of chemical powders  a small bottle and a book Please take everything back to your house</p>
<p>If you leave as soon as you receve this letter  you shouldbe back home before midnight At that time you will recevea visit from a man Please give him the bottle  the powdersand the book  and I shall aways be grateful to you</p>
<p>Do not fail me  Lanyon  Believe me  my life and mypeace of mind depend on you I am in fearful danger and only you can save me</p>
<p>Your friend</p>
<p>Henry Jekyll</p>
<p>After reading this letter  I was sure that Doctor Jekyll wasmad  But a friend is a friend  and so I went at once to hishouse Jekyll&#x27;s servant had received by the same post a letter similar to mine  and he was waiting for me with the locksmith Together we went through the old laboratory andclimbed the stairs to the doctor&#x27;s private study The doorwas very strong  with an excellent lock  but the locksmithknew his job Soon the door stood open and I entered thestudy I opened the cupboard and found the shelf Sureenough the powders the bottle and the book were there and I took them home with me</p>
<p>At home I lcoked at everything more carefully There wereseveral packets of white powder and a bottle of red strong smelling liquid The book contained nothing except alist of dates  going back several years The last date wasnearly a year ago Here and there the doctor had added afew words The word donble appeared very early in thelist  followed by the word Failed     Double appeared inthe list several more times What was Jekyll doing Thebook looked like a list of unsuccessful experiments Howcould I by taking these things to my house save my friend&#x27;s life and peace of mind And what was the reason for thismidnight visitor  I put my old gun in my pocket  then I putevery thing in a box for my midnight visitor to collect</p>
<p>At midnight exactly there was a knock on my door  A shortman was standing in the shadows</p>
<p>Are you from Doctor Jekyll  I asked He bent his head</p>
<p>Although I could not see his face there was something unpleasing about him and I was glad I had a weapon I invitedhim into the house and there  in the bright light  I took a closer look at him</p>
<p>His appearance was extremely strange  His clothes werewell made and expensive  but they were far too large forhim  He looked like a child wearing his father&#x27;s clothes  butthere was nothing childlike about this man  He was short  asI have said  but very strong At the same time there was alook of sickness and horror about him and his face was amask of pain  violence and hate As a doctor I could pernapsfeel sorry for him as a mau I felt only fear and dislike</p>
<p>you got it  said the stranger impatiently reachingout his hand and touching my arm  His touch made my bloodrun cold I shook off his hand  Come  sir   I said calmly  Sit down and introduce yourself</p>
<p>I apologize  Doctor Lanyon  the stranger said more politely  Doctor Henry Jekyll sent me here on an importantmatter I have to collect something from you</p>
<p>I gave him the box He took it with trembling hands   Atlast  he cried He turned to me His face was deathly pale  Have you a medicine glass  he asked</p>
<p>I gave it to him He put a little of the red liquid in the glassand added a packet of powder A small cloud of smoke rosefrom the glass and the colour of the liquid changed from redto purple  and from purple to a watery green The strangerput the glass down on the table and looked sharply at me</p>
<p>And now  he said  choose carefully You can leave theroom now  Or you can stay and experience something new something unknown to science  You can be rich famous andsuccessful if only you will believe</p>
<p>Sir  I said trying to remain calm  I don&#x27;t understandwhat you&#x27;re trying to say and I think you are probably madBut I will stay</p>
<p>Very well  said the stranger  Now remember yourpromise  You&#x27;ve been an unbeliever all your life Youlaughed at Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s ideas and called them unscientificrubbish-now see for yourself</p>
<p>He put the glass to his lips and drank the liquid His wholebody shook and jumped and he almost fell He held onto theedge of the table  breathing fast through his open mouth  AsI watched his whole body seemed to change He seemed tobecome taller  fatter-his face turned black and its shapebegan to change The next moment I jumped back againstthe wall trembling with fear and horror There before myeyes  pale and shaken and sick  stood Henry Jekyll</p>
<p>I cannot make myself write down the things that Jekyll with tears in his eyes  confessed to me that night</p>
<p>Now fear and horror are my only companions Sleep has left me and I feel that I have not long to live  As I write  Iwonder  Did I imagine it all As a scientist I cannot believeit-but I saw it happen with my own eyes</p>
<p>I will say just one thing more Utterson The evil thing thatcame into my house that night-as Jekyll told me-wasknown by the name of Hyde  and was wanted by the policefor the murder of Sir Danvers Carew</p>
<p>Hastie Lanyon</p>
<p>With fear in his heart Mr Utterson put away Doctor Lanyon&#x27;s letter  and then opened the confession of Doctor Henry Jekyll</p>
<p>9  Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s confession</p>
<p>I was born in the year 18-  I inherited a large fortune a strong healthy body and an excellent mind  I wasnaturally hard working and soon I was extremely successful inmy chosen work as a scientist Although I was still young important people came to me for advice At an age when mostyoung men are going out and having fun  I was behaving like agrey haired old man</p>
<p>This was not easy for me The outside world saw a serious hard working doctor  Behind this quiet character  however was an active  fun-loving young man-about-town  This  ofcourse  was nothing to be ashamed of  but I did not realizethat at the time  I was ashamed  and I soon learned to keepmy two lives separate</p>
<p>I was not dishonest in any way Both these people were me The serious  successful young doctor was me  and the wild fun-loving irresponsible young man was me too I thought about this for a long time and slowly I realized that I was notextraordinary in this  Every man has two sides to hischaracter  He is two people They live together-often uncomfortably in the same body</p>
<p>How fantastic  I thought  if I could separate these twocharacters and give my fun loving side his freedom  Then hecould go out and enjoy himself unashamedly and leave serious studious Doctor Jekyll to get on with his important  life-savingwork</p>
<p>Was it possible   I wondered  to find a drug that couldgive each side of my characier its own separate face and body</p>
<p>After much thought and careful study I believed I had foundthe answer I had read many scientific books and spent manyhours in my laboratory searching for the right mixture ofchemicals to make my drug At last I had everything I neededexcept a special kind of salt  I bought some from a chemist and then I was ready</p>
<p>I hesitated for a long time before I began my experiment Only a small mistake in the mixture of the drug could meanimmediate death But in the end my wish to know wasstronger than my fear And so  late one disastrous night  Imixed everything together and prepared my drug I watchedthe smoke rising from the liquid as it changed colour from redto purple and at last to green Then  bravely I drank everybitter drop</p>
<p>I felt a violent sickness in my stomach and a terrible pain inall my bones The room seemed to turn round and round and Itrembled with fear Then the fear and pain disappeared and astrange  sweet feeling took its place  Wild thoughts dancedthrough my mind  They were not good serious thoughtsThey were the wild passions of an evil and cruel stranger  Butinside myself I felt younger  lighter  more carefree than everbefore  If this is pure evil  I thought  I like it</p>
<p>I stood there  enjoying these strange new thoughts and passions-and suddenly realized that I was shorter At that timethere was no mirror in my stidy  Later I put one on the wallof my study so that I could watch these changes in my appearance Now however it was three o clock in the morning andall the servants were asleep I decided it was safe to go to mybedroom in my new body and take a look at myself in the mirror there I crossed the garden and entered my house like astranger  As I came into my room  I saw Edward Hyde forthe first time</p>
<p>At that time the good side of my character was strongerthan the evil side Henry Jekyll had his faults but he wasmostly a good  kind man I cannot be sure but I believe thatis the reason why Edward Hyde was so much smaller thanHenry Jekyll But that was not the only difference betweenthe two men  Henry Jekyll had a kind  open  honest face Pure evil stared out of Edward Hyde&#x27;s eyes I felt no dislike however Indeed I welcomed him Edward Hyde was me young and strong and full of life</p>
<p>Later however I noticed that Hyde&#x27;s appearance andmanner had a strong effect on other people  Nobody couldmeet Edward Hyde without a feeling of dislike and horror  Ibelieve I understand the reason for this too  Everyone is a mixture of good and evil Even the worst criminal has a little goodin him  Only Edward Hyde was pure evil</p>
<p>I stood for a long time staring at the mirror  Am Itrapped  I wondered  If I am I must leave this house beforedaylight  If I don&#x27;t  I shall be arrested as a thief</p>
<p>I hurried back to my study  With trembling hands I mixedanother dose of the drug and drank it Again I felt that terriblePain and sickness  but a few seconds later I found myself withthe face and body and character of Henry Jekyll once more</p>
<p>I blame myself for the things that happened later  It wasnot the fault of the drug That was neither good nor evil Butit opened the prison doors and all owed Edward Hyde toescape Soon he was out of control  He  you will remember was wholly evil Doctor Jekyll was not wholly good  however He was a normal man with normal faults and weaknesses  andHyde was too strong for him</p>
<p>I welcomed Hyde therefore I arranged everything verycarefully I bought a flat in a poor part of London  where Ikept Hyde&#x27;s clothes and employed a servant to do the housework I took a dose of the drug whenever I wanted to forgetmy old  quiet  serious self for a time  In those early daysGod forgive me -I thought it was all very amusing  DoctorJekyll was well known Nobody knew Hyde  however  and inhis body I was free to do as I wished</p>
<p>I will not go into details about my adventures and shamefulacts as Hyde  Jekyll remained as good and kind as ever and always did his best to undo the harm that Hyde did  But as timewent by  Jekyll became less and less able to control Hyde</p>
<p>One night Hyde injured a child in the street and a passer bysaw him That passer by was your cousin  I recognized himwhen the two of you came to my window Your cousin caughtHyde and an angry crowd collected  They asked for money forthe child&#x27;s family  In the end  in order to escape  Hyde hadto give your cousin a cheque in the name of Jekyll</p>
<p>I learned my lesson from this  and opened a new bank account in the name of Hyde  I even gave Hyde a different handwriting  I was sure I was safe-but I was wrong</p>
<p>Two months before the murder of Sir Danvers Carew I wentout on one of my evil adventures Before I went to bed I tooka dose of the drug and became Doctor Jekyll once more  Iwoke up in bed the next morning with a strange feeling thatsomething was wrong  I looked around the room  thendown at my hand Henry Jekyll&#x27;s hand was large white  andwellmade  but the hand I saw that morning on the bedcoverwas thin bony  greyish brown  and hairy It was the hand ofEdward Hyde</p>
<p>Sick with horror  I stared at it  I was Henry Jekyll when Iwent to bed  I thought  And now I am Edward Hyde What possible explanation can there be  And moreimportant  how can I get to my study and take the drug</p>
<p>Then I realized that the servants were quite used to the comings and goings of Hyde  I put on Hyde&#x27;s clothes and marchedconfidently through the house  Poole stared in surprise to seeMr Hyde so early in the morning  but I did not care  Tenminutes later Doctor Jekyll had returned to his own shape andwas sitting down pretending to eat breakfast</p>
<p>Too worried to eat  I sat there thinking hard about my situation  I realized that in recent weeks Hyde had become biggerand stronger  both in body and character</p>
<p>What will I do  I thought   Hyde takes control  Ithought about the drug  Once in the early days it had failedcompletely  and sometimes I had had to take a double dose before I changed into Hyde Now however it was quite easy tobecome Hyde-the problem was to become Jekyll again aftermy adventures My good self and my evil self were fighting formy mind and body-and my evil self was winning</p>
<p>I knew I had to choose between the two  and I chose DoctorJekyll  Perhaps I was not wholly serious about this however because I did not sell Hyde&#x27;s flat or destroy his clothes  Fortwo months I lived the life of a quiet and responsible man  Butsoon I began to miss Hyde-his strong young body  his love oflife and his dark adventures in the narrow  nameless streets ofLondon One night  when my life as Jekyll seemed imposslblydull and boring  I mixed a dose of the drug and drank it</p>
<p>It was like opening the door of a cage and letting a wild animal escape That night I became a madman  and beat Sir Danvers to death-for no reason at all I felt only a wild delight asI hit his body again and again  Afterwards I ran to the flat anddestroyed all my papers  I was not ashamed of my crime  Instead I was filled with a high sweet excitement  I relived themurder as I walked back home through the streets  I feltstrong and masterful Edward Hyde had a song on his lipsas he mixed a dose of the drug  Your very good health  SirDanvers  he laughed as he drank A moment of terrible pain then poor Henry Jekyll fell to his knees and begged God to forgive him</p>
<p>When I was myself again I locked the door that led fromthe street to my laboratory  I broke the key and threw itaway  Goodbye for ever Mr Hyde I whispered</p>
<p>The next day the news of the murder was all over London The servant girl had seen the crime and recognized Mr Hyde My other self was wanted by the police</p>
<p>In some ways I was glad  Now Hyde could not show hisface to the world again  If he did  every honest man in London would be proud to report him to the police</p>
<p>Once again I led a busy responsible and almost happy life until one fine clear January day  I was sitting on a seat inthe park enjoying the sunshine when suddenly I felt deathlysick I began to tremble all over  Soon  however  I felt wellagain not only well  but young strong and fearless  I lookeddown  my clothes were suddenly too big the hand on my kneewas the bony hairy hand of Edward Hyde  It was so sudden One moment I was a famous and popular doctor the next Iwas a violent criminal who was wanted for murder</p>
<p>How could I get to my study to take the drug  I had lockedthe street door to my laboratory and broken the key  I couldnot  therefore enter from the street  I could not go inthrough the house because of the servants I needed help fromoutside I thought of Lanyon but how could I reach him And how could I persuade him to let Hyde into his home How too could I persuade him to break into Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s private study It looked impossible  Then I remembered My appearance was unrecognizable but my handwriting was unchanged I could still write a letterin Doctor Jekyll&#x27;s name Calling a passing taxicab I orderedthe driver to drive to a hotel quite near Lanyon&#x27;s house Ofcourse Jekyll&#x27;s clothes were much too large for my body and Ihad trouble in climbing into the cab The driver noticed mystrange appearance and could not help laughing I gave himsuch a black look however that the smile froze on his face In my desperate fear and danger I was like a pain-maddened animal ready to kill or wound at any moment I wanted topull the driver from his seat and murder him then and there But I was clever too My life depended on my coolness and Ifought to control my murderous passions</p>
<p>We reached the hotel I paid the driver and went inside holding up my too-large trousers The servants smiled whenthey saw my strange appearance I stared angrily at them andtheir smiles disappeared at once I gave my orders and they ledme to a private room and brought me some writing paper and apen</p>
<p>Hyde in danger of his life was a new experience for me He I write he because I find it hard to write I  he wasnot human His only feelings at that time were fear and hate Hyde was wholly evil but he was not stupid He knew thathis life depended on two letters one to Lanyon and one toPoole If he failed he would die</p>
<p>Carefully he wrote the letters and sent a servant to postthem After that he sat all day by the fire in the private room There too he had dinner brought by a frightened waiter Atlast when darkness had covered the city he sat in the cornerof a closed taxicab  Just drive round  he ordered and thedriver drove backwards and forwards through the streets ofLondon</p>
<p>Then when Hyde thought the driver was beginning to sus-pect something he sent the taxicab away and continued onfoot He was a strange figure in his too-large clothes withfear and hate staring out of his eyes He walked along talkingto himself Once a woman spoke to him  Will you buy my matches sir  she begged Hyde hit heracross the face and she ran away in fear.</p>
<p>My plan was successful And when I arrived in Lanyon&#x27;s house I took the dose of the drug that returned me to my nor-mal appearance</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards I felt deeply ashamed Perhaps itwas Lanyon&#x27;s horror that made me feel like that.I do notknow But I hated myself and I was conscious of an importantchange in my feelings I was no longer afraid of the police-Iwas afraid of Hyde himself The thought of his short strong hairy body and his evil cruel wholly selfish mind filled mewith horror</p>
<p>Exhausted by the horrors of that day I slept heavily Iwoke in the morning feeling weak and shaky but quitenormal I still hated and feared the thought of the wild animalinside me and I had not forgotten the desperate dangers of theday before But I was at home and close to my drugs and Iwas most deeply grateful for my escape</p>
<p>I was walking across the garden after breakfast enjoyingthe clear wintry air when suddenly my body was again tornby those indescribable feelings which I always experienced af-ter a dose of the drug I only just reached my study before Iwas again burning and freezing with the violent passions ofHyde With feverish speed I mixed the drug This time I hadto take a double dose to return to my old shape And then on-ly six hours later the pains returned and I had to repeat thedose</p>
<p>From that day onwards the situation worsened I neededlarger and more frequent doses in order to stay in Jekyll&#x27;s body The pains came unexpectedly but most of all when Iwas asleep I was afraid to go to bed or even to sleep for afew moments in my chair If I did so I always woke as Hyde</p>
<p>Soon Jekyll was a sick man feverish and weakened by painand fear As Jekyll grew weaker Hyde became stronger thanever He burned with hate for everybody and everything AndHyde and Jekyll now hated each other with equal passion Jekyll hated Hyde because Hyde was evil and inhuman andbecause Hyde was stronger than he was Jekyll lived in fear ofwaking up and finding himself in Hyde&#x27;s body with allHyde&#x27;s evil passions Hyde hated Jekyll for a different reason His fear of death-the punishment for murder-drove him tothe hiding-place of Jekyll&#x27;s body But he hated this prison andwas always fighting to escape from Jekyll&#x27;s mind and body and take control He also hated Jekyll&#x27;s weakness and his sad hopeless condition Most of all,he hated Jekyll&#x27;s dislike ofhim This was why Hyde sometimes did things to annoyJekyll He tore the doctor&#x27;s books and wrote all over them.He burned his letters and even destroyed a picture of thedoctor&#x27;s dead father</p>
<p>Only Hyde&#x27;s fear of his own death stops him from killingme His love of life is terribly strong and he knows that if hekills me he too will die I almost feel sorry for him</p>
<p>It is useless to continue this confession The final disasterhas arrived and will put an end to my punishment I shallsoon lose my own face and character for ever I have only afew doses of the drug left I sent Poole to the same chemist tofetch some more chemicals When he brought them I mixed adose of the drug The liquid smoked and changed from red topurple but it did not turn green I drank it and looked in themirror But there was no effect Edward Hyde&#x27;s face stillstared back at me</p>
<p>I expect Poole has told you that I have searched London forthe chemicals I need It is no good I have decided that thefirst chemicals I bought were not absolutely pure By accident they contained something unknown to myself or to the chemistthat prepared them And that unknown something made mydrug effective So my drug was an accidental discovery thatcannot be repeated</p>
<p>About a week has passed I have used the last of the oldchemicals and for the moment I am Henry Jekyll again But Icannot write much more-I have very little time If Hyde re-turns while I am writing this confession he will tear it topieces to annoy me If I finish it however he will probablynot notice it He lives only for the moment and he is already achanged man He is like a trapped animal now He sits in mychair trembling and weeping with hate and fear All the timehe listens for the policeman&#x27;s knock at the door Will he becaught at last and put to death Or will he be brave enough totake a dose of poison at the last moment</p>
<p>Well that is not my business This is the true hour of mydeath When you read this the Henry Jekyll you know will bedead The rest of the story is about Edward Hyde Now as Iput down my pen I bring the life of unhappy Henry Jekyll toan end</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a
