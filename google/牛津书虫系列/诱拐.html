<p>It was early in the month of June 1751 when I shut the door of our house behind me for the last time All my life I had lived in the quiet little village of Essendean in the Lowlands of Scotland where my father had been the dominie or schoolteacher But now that he and my mother were both dead I had to leave the house The new dominie would soon arrive and he would teach at the school and live in the dominie&#x27;s house So although I was only seventeen there was nowhere for me to live and no reason for me to stay in Essendean</p>
<p>But my heart was beating with excitement as I walked down the road because in my hand I carried the letter that my father had given me just before he died  Davie  he had said  when I am dead take this to the house of Shaws near Cramond That&#x27;s where I came from and that&#x27;s where you must go Put this letter into the hands of Ebenezer Balfour</p>
<p>Balfour The same name as my own It was the first time I had heard of any of our family outside Essendean</p>
<p>So I decided to walk to Cramond hoping that perhaps this Mr Balfour in his fine big house would receive me kindly and help me to become a rich man one day With my plaid over my shoulder I walked fast up the hill away from the village What an adventure to leave that sleepy place where nothing ever happened and go to a great busy house to be with rich and important people of my own name and blood But when I reached the top of the hill I turned a little sadly to take my last look at the dominie&#x27;s house and Essendean churchyard where my father and mother lay</p>
<p>My journey northwards took almost two days By midday on the second day I could see the smoking chimneys of Edinburgh in front of me and soon I arrived in Cramond</p>
<p>Now I began to ask people on the road for the house of Shaws Their answers worried me a little Some people seemed surprised some afraid and some angry when I spoke the name of Ebenezer Balfour I could not understand this but it was too far to go back to Essendean that day  and I wanted to find the rest of the Balfour family very much So I continued on my way and when I met a dark wild-looking woman coming towards me I asked her where the house of Shaws was She took me to the top of the next hill and showed me a large building standing alone in the bottom of the next valley Although the fields around were green and the farmland was excellent the house itself looked unfinished and empty Part of its roof was missing There was no road to it and no smoke coming from any of its chimneys nor was there any garden   That  I cried  No it can&#x27;t be    It is  cried the woman angrily  That is the house of Shaws Blood built it blood stopped the building of if and blood shall bring it down Black is the heart of Ebenezer Balfour Ye can tell him from me that I hope to see him die and his house fall down around him   The woman turned and disappeared I stood where she left me shaking like a leaf and looking down at the house for a long time But when it began to get dark I noticed some smoke coming out of the chimney and felt a little more hope ful  There must be a fire and cooking and people in the house  I thought So I walked up to the front door The house seemed locked up and unwelcoming but there was fire light shining through the kitchen window and I could hear someone talking quietly to himself Bravely I lifted my hand and knocked loudly on the strong wooden door The house was suddenly silent and there was no reply I knocked and knocked and shouted as loudly as I could Finally the win dow opened and a man holding a gun put his head out</p>
<p>What do ye want  he asked</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve come here with a letter for Mr Ebenezer Balfour of Shaws Is he here</p>
<p>Who is it from  asked the man with the gun</p>
<p>That&#x27;s none of your business  I replied getting angry</p>
<p>Well put the letter down by the door and leave</p>
<p>I will not  I answered sharply  I&#x27;m going to give it to Mr Balfour himself The letter introduces me to him</p>
<p>Who are ye then  was the next question</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not ashamed of my name  It&#x27;s David Balfour</p>
<p>The man almost dropped his gun After a long while he asked in a changed voice  Is your father dead  I was too surprised to answer but he continued  Aye he must be dead and that&#x27;s why ye have come Well man I&#x27;ll let ye in  and he disappeared from the window</p>
<p>Now the door was unlocked and a voice from the darkness said  Go into the kitchen and touch nothing  I obeyed while the man locked the heavy door carefully again I found myself in the emptiest kitchen that I had ever seen There was a fire but no other light On the table was a bowl of porridge and a glass of water in front of the only chair Around the walls were several locked chests There was no other furniture The man who now appeared in the kitchen was small mean-looking and white-faced between fifty and sev enty years old and wearing a dirty old nightshirt The worst thing about him was that he could neither take his eyes away from me nor look straight into my face</p>
<p>If ye&#x27;re hungry  he said  ye can eat that porridge It&#x27;s grand food porridge Let me see the letter</p>
<p>It&#x27;s for Mr Balfour not you  I replied</p>
<p>And who do ye think I am Give me Alexander&#x27;s letter Ye may not like me or my house or my porridge but I&#x27;m your born uncle Davie my man</p>
<p>This was the end of all my hopes I was too tired and miser able to speak so I silently gave him the letter and sat down to eat the porridge</p>
<p>Your father&#x27;s been dead a long time  he asked giving me a quick look from his sharp eyes</p>
<p>Three weeks sir  I said</p>
<p>He was a secretive man Alexander was Perhaps he didn&#x27;t talk much about me  Or about the house of Shaws</p>
<p>I never knew he had a brother sir or ever heard the name of Shaws</p>
<p>To think of that  he replied  A strange man  But he seemed very pleased and began to look at me with more inter est Soon he jumped up and said  We&#x27;re going to get on well Davie What&#x27;s mine is yours man and what&#x27;s yours is mine Blood&#x27;s thicker than water and there&#x27;s only ye and me of the name of Balfour  Now I&#x27;ll show ye to your bed</p>
<p>He took me up some dark stairs and showed me into a room I could not see anything   Can I have a light sir  I asked   No ye can&#x27;t No lights in this house I&#x27;m afraid of fires ye see Good night to ye Davie my man  And before I had time to reply he pulled the door shut and locked it from the outside The room was very cold but luckily I had my plaid with me so I covered myself with it like a blanket and soon fell asleep</p>
<p>The next day my uncle and I had a small bowl of porridge and a glass of water for breakfast lunch and supper He did not speak much to me but was clearly thinking hard I often noticed him looking at me while pretending to do something different  and he never left me alone in the kitchen with the locked chests in which I supposed he kept his money I did not like the way he looked at me and began to wonder if he was a little crazy and perhaps dangerous</p>
<p>After supper he said suddenly  Davie I&#x27;ve been thinking I promised your father a bit of money for ye before ye were born A promise is a promise and so I&#x27;m going to give ye forty pounds   These last words seemed very painful to him He added in a kind of scream  Scots</p>
<p>A Scottish pound was the same as an English shilling I could see that his story was a lie so I laughed at him saying  Oh think again sir English pounds surely</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I said &#x27;replied my uncle quickly  Go outside for a moment and I&#x27;ll get the money for ye</p>
<p>I was smiling as I went out sure that he would give me nothing at all It was a dark night and I could hear wind in the hills  There may be thunder later  I thought not knowing how important the weather would be to me that night</p>
<p>But when my uncle called me in again he counted thirty eight English pounds in gold into my hands It clearly hurt him to do it and he kept back the last two pounds but I did not mind that Surprised and pleased I thanked him warmly</p>
<p>Now  he said looking cleverly at me  ye can give me something Davie I&#x27;m getting old now and I need help</p>
<p>Of course sir  I answered  What can I do</p>
<p>Well go outside and climb the stairs at the other end of the house where the building isn&#x27;t finished yet Go up to the room at the top and bring down the chest that ye&#x27;ll find there It&#x27;s got valuable papers in it</p>
<p>Can I have a light sir  I asked</p>
<p>No  he said sharply  No lights in my house    Very well sir Are the stairs good</p>
<p>They&#x27;re grand   said he  The stairs are grand Out I went into the night As I was feeling my way along the outside wall there was a sudden flash of lightning then darkness again I found the stairs and started climbing I was about fifteen metres above the ground when there was another flash of lightning That was lucky for me because it showed me that the steps were uneven  and that I could easily fall to my death  These are the grand stairs  I thought  Perhaps my uncle wants me to die  Now I was very careful and I felt each step with my hands before I put my foot on it A few steps later my hand felt cold stone and then nothing more The stairs ended there twenty metres above the ground I felt cold with fear when I thought of the danger that I had been in Sending a stranger up those stairs in the dark was sending him straight to his death</p>
<p>Angrily I turned and felt my way down There was a crash of thunder and suddenly the rain came down At the bottom of the stairs I looked towards the kitchen and could see in the next flash of lightning a figure standing still in the doorway listening  When the thunder sounded again louder than before he ran back inside and I followed as softly as I could I found him sitting in the kitchen drinking whisky straight from the bottle and shaking with fear Quietly I came up behind him and putting my hands sud denly on his shoulders cried  Ah</p>
<p>My uncle gave a kind of broken cry and fell to the floor like a dead man His face was a strange blue colour and I began to think that he really was dead At last his eyes opened and he looked up and saw me  Oh man are ye alive or a ghost  he cried  Get me my medicine Davie it&#x27;s for my heart  I found the medicine bottle and gave him some He soon began to look a little better   Why did you lie to me  I asked angrily  Why did you give me money  And why did you try to kill me  Answer me</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell ye tomorrow Davie I promise Help me to bed now will ye  He still looked very ill so I could not refuse But this time I locked his bedroom door and went to sleep in front of the kitchen fire</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning I felt very pleased with myself  He thinks he&#x27;s cleverer than me but he isn&#x27;t  I thought When I let my uncle out of his room I asked him again for an explanation After a while he said  Davie I have some business with a ship&#x27;s captain at Queensferry Now we could walk over there and when I&#x27;ve done my business we could visit the lawyer Mr Rankeillor He&#x27;ll answer all your questions He&#x27;s an honest man and he knew your father What do ye say to that</p>
<p>I thought for a moment I had never seen the sea but had always wanted to  It&#x27;s a grand idea  I said</p>
<p>It was a morning&#x27;s walk to Queensferry Which was west of Edinburgh but we did not say a word to each other on the way Suddenly at the top of a hill we could see the Firth of Forth below us blue and calm with white sails on it</p>
<p>Ye see that public house  asked my uncle  Captain Hoseason&#x27;s there to do business with me There&#x27;s the ship&#x27;s boat on the beach waiting to take him to the ship And there&#x27;s the ship itself A grand ship</p>
<p>I had to agree with him The sailors were getting the ship ready for sailing and I thought what an exciting adventure that would be to sail away to a foreign country</p>
<p>We walked down the hill to the public house and met the captain there He was a tall dark serious-looking man who shook hands politely with me Stupidly I left these two men to their business and ran down to the beach to talk to the sailors and look at the boats It was all new and very interest ing to me</p>
<p>As I was coming back I met the owner of the public house</p>
<p>Good morning  he said  Did ye come with Ebenezer</p>
<p>I did  I replied  He isn&#x27;t well liked I understand</p>
<p>That&#x27;s true  he answered  Nobody speaks well of him It all started with that story about Mr Alexander his brother</p>
<p>What story  I asked</p>
<p>Oh just that Ebenezer had killed him Did ye never hear that</p>
<p>And why would he kill my f  I mean Alexander</p>
<p>To get the house of course the house of Shaws</p>
<p>Aye man Was my was Alexander older than Ebenezer</p>
<p>Indeed he was No other reason for killing him</p>
<p>This was a great surprise to me I had thought that my fa ther was the younger brother and I now understood why my uncle had lied to me and wanted to kill me The house of Shaws had belonged to my father not my uncle and now I had inherited it The poor country boy who had walked from Essendean was the owner of a fine house and farmland My head was full of the wonderful things that I could do in my life as I looked unseeing at the sea</p>
<p>Just then my uncle and the captain came out of the public house The captain smiled in a friendly way as he spoke to me  Sir  he said  Mr Balfour has told me a lot about ye I&#x27;m only sorry I haven&#x27;t time to get to know ye better But I&#x27;d like ye to come on to my ship for half an hour before we sail and have a drink with me</p>
<p>Now more than anything in the world I wanted to see the inside of a ship but I remembered that I had to be careful  My uncle and I have to see the lawyer sir  I replied  so I&#x27;m afraid we may not have enough time</p>
<p>Aye aye  he answered  I know but ye see the ship&#x27;s boat can put ye both down near Rankeillor&#x27;s house after ye&#x27;ve seen the ship so ye won&#x27;t lose any time   Suddenly he said quietly in my ear  Watch out for the old man he wants to hurt ye Come and talk about it  Putting his arm in mine he said loudly  What can I bring ye back from my travels  A friend of Mr Balfour&#x27;s is a friend of mine</p>
<p>By this time we were on the beach  and he was helping my uncle and me into the boat I thought that I had found a good friend and helper and I was very excited as we came closer to the great ship full of busy noisy sailors The captain and I were the first to climb up the ship&#x27;s side and at the top the captain immediately put his arm through mine and began to talk about the ship</p>
<p>But where is my uncle  I asked suddenly I pulled myself away from the captain&#x27;s arm and ran to the side of the ship Sure enough there was the boat returning to Queensferry with my uncle sitting in it I screamed  Help  help Murder  and my uncle slowly turned to look at me</p>
<p>I did not see any more Already strong hands were pulling me away Then something hit my head I saw a great flash of fire and fell to the ground</p>
<p>2 Kidnapped</p>
<p>When I woke up in darkness my head was hurting badly and I was unable to move my hands or feet I could hear the sailors  shouts and the sound of the wind and the waves The whole world seemed to go up up up and then down again I felt very ill and at first could not under stand what was happening After a while I realized that I must be somewhere inside the ship which was moving very fast through the water  I&#x27;ve been kidnapped  I thought angrily It was clear that my uncle and the captain had planned it together I began to feel frightened and hopeless as I lay there in the dark</p>
<p>Some hours later a light shone in my face Mr Riach one of the ship&#x27;s officers stood looking down at me He washed the cut on my head gave me some water and told me kindly to go to sleep The next time he came I was feeling very hot and ill He had brought Captain Hoseason with him</p>
<p>Now sir see for yourself   said Mr Riach  The lad&#x27;s seriously ill We must take him out of this unhealthy hole at once</p>
<p>That&#x27;s none of your business  answered the captain  Ye&#x27;re paid to do your job not to worry about the by He&#x27;s staying down here</p>
<p>I&#x27;m only paid to be an officer on this ship   replied Mr Riach sharply He looked hard at the captain  I&#x27;m not paid like you to kidnap and murder</p>
<p>Hoseason turned on him angrily  What did ye say  be cried  What do ye mean</p>
<p>You understand   said Mr Riach looking calmly at him</p>
<p>You should know me by now Mr Riach I&#x27;m a hard man But if ye say the lad will die</p>
<p>Aye he will   said Mr Riach</p>
<p>Well sir put him where ye like</p>
<p>So I was carried up into the sunlight a few minutes later and put in a cabin where some of the sailors were sleeping It was a wonderful feeling to see the daylight and to be able to talk to people again I lay in the cabin for several days and after a while began to feel better The sailors were kind to me in their way They brought me food and drink  and told me about their families at home I discovered from them that the ship was sailing to the Carolinas in North America There the captain was planning to sell me as a slave to work in a rich man&#x27;s house or on a farm</p>
<p>I also learnt that both the ship&#x27;s officers Mr Riach and Mr Shuan enjoyed drinking far too much The sailors liked Mr Shuan but said that he was sometimes violent when he had drunk a lot One of the sailors was a young boy  called Ransome His job was to bring meals to the captain and officers in the round-house a big cabin on the top of the ship where the officers slept and ate When Ransome dropped something or did something wrong Mr Shuan used to hit him and I often saw the poor boy crying</p>
<p>One night about nine o clock I heard one of the sailors in the cabin saying quietly to the others  Shuan&#x27;s killed him at last  We all knew who he meant Just then the captain came in I was surprised to see him walk towards me and say kindly  My man We Want ye to help us in the round-house From now on ye&#x27;ll sleep there instead of Ransome  As he spoke two sailors carried Ransome into the cabin His face was as white as a sheet and he did not move My blood ran cold when I saw him</p>
<p>I obeyed the captain and ran to the round-house It was a large room with a table a bench and locked cupboards All the best food and drink was kept there under the captain&#x27;s eyes as well as the guns When I entered I saw Mr Shuan sitting at the table with a bottle of whisky in front of him He did not seem to notice what was happening around him and was looking fixedly at the table</p>
<p>Mr Riach soon joined the captain and me He looked at Hoseason meaningfully and I understood from his look that Ransome was dead We three all stood silently looking down at Mr Shuan</p>
<p>Suddenly the captain stepped forward  Do ye know what ye&#x27;ve done  he cried  Ye&#x27;ve murdered the boy</p>
<p>Mr Shuan put a hand to his head  Well  he said  he brought me a dirty glass</p>
<p>The captain and Mr Riach and I looked at each other almost frightened Then Hoseason took Mr Shuan by the arm and told him to go to bed The murderer cried a little at first but he took off his boots and lay down like a small child</p>
<p>Mr Riach   said the captain when we could see that Mr Shuan was asleep  nobody on land must know what happened tonight We&#x27;ll say that the boy fell into the sea Get us a drink David we both need one  and he gave me the key to the cupboards</p>
<p>In the next few days I was very busy running here and there with the officers food and drink Mr Riach and the cap tain were surprisingly patient with me when I made mistakes Perhaps they were thinking of the poor boy who had died But Mr Shuan was very strange after Ransome&#x27;s death  He did not seem to know what he had done or to recognize me On my second day in the round-house he looked at me with a white face and fear in his eyes  You weren&#x27;t here before  he asked</p>
<p>No sir  I replied</p>
<p>There was another boy  he asked  Ah Yes I thought so  and sitting down he called for some more whisky</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a hard life for me I was able to eat well and talk to Mr Riach who spoke to me like a friend But I could not forget poor Ransome As the days passed I became more and more worried I knew that when the ship arrived in the Carolinas I would no longer be a free man but a slave I thought hard but there did not seem to be any way of escaping</p>
<p>About a week later we were sailing round the rocky coast of northern Scotland in very bad weather It was difficult to see anything because of the thick fog One evening there was a great crash and the officers ran out to see what had happened I thought we had hit a rock but in fact it was a small boat As we watched the boat broke in two and went to the bottom with all its men except the one passenger At the moment of the crash this man managed to jump up and catch the side of the ship and pull himself up</p>
<p>The captain brought him into the round-house He was smallish but well-built with an open sunburnt face and bright amused eyes When he took off his long coat I could see that he had a pair of pistols and was wearing a sword at his side Although his life had clearly been in great danger he seemed very calm and spoke politely to the captain Hoseason was looking with interest at the man&#x27;s clothes He Was Wear ing a hat with feathers a blue coat with silver buttons and expensive-looking lace round his neck</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry about the boat sir   said the captain</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve lost some grand friends today   replied the stranger  and that&#x27;s worse than losing ten boats</p>
<p>Well sir there are more men in the world than boats   replied the captain still watching him closely  I know be cause I&#x27;ve been in France like you</p>
<p>He said these last words clearly and carefully They seemed to have a special meaning The stranger put his hand quickly on his pistol</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry   said Hoseason  Ye&#x27;ve a French soldier&#x27;s coat on your back and a Scottish tongue in your head that&#x27;s true but so has many an honest man these days</p>
<p>Well sir   replied the stranger  I must tell you that I&#x27;m one of those honest Highlanders who were proud to fight for their homes their clan and their country in 1745 against the English King And I must tell you another thing If King George&#x27;s soldiers find me I&#x27;ll be in trouble I was on my way to France where some of my clansmen live now But in the fog my boat missed the French ship that was meeting me So if you can take me to France I&#x27;ll pay you well</p>
<p>He opened his purse and showed that it was full of gold coins The captain seemed excited as he looked at the money and then at the man&#x27;s face</p>
<p>To France  he replied  No I can&#x27;t do that But to the Highlands aye we can discuss that   They sat down together and in the end agreed that the captain would take the stranger to Loch Linnhe on the northwest coast of Scot land for sixty pounds There the Highlander would be among friends and safe from the English army He and Hoseason shook hands and the captain left me alone with the stranger</p>
<p>He had told the captain that the gold was not his own Some of the Highlanders had escaped to France after the Forty-Five but their friends and clansmen in Scotland sometimes managed to find a little money to send them It was this man&#x27;s job to take the money across to France and he did this by travelling secretly to Scotland as often as possible I thought he was very brave  If he&#x27;s caught by the English army they&#x27;ll kill him   I told myself I liked the way he seemed to enjoy living dangerously</p>
<p>When he asked me for whisky I had to go to ask the cap tain for the key to the cupboard I found Hoseason and his officers talking quietly in a corner and heard them planning to kill the stranger and steal his money They seemed to think that I would help them and asked me to bring them secretly some guns from the round-house I went slowly back to the stranger not sure what I should do But when I entered the round-house and saw him eating his supper I decided at once</p>
<p>They&#x27;re going to attack you and murder you   I told him</p>
<p>What  he cried jumping up  Will ye stand with me against them</p>
<p>I will  I&#x27;m no thief or murderer  I replied bravely</p>
<p>Are ye for King George</p>
<p>More or less  I answered</p>
<p>Well Mr More-or-Less what&#x27;s your name</p>
<p>David Balfour  I said and then thinking that a man with so fine a coat must like fine people I added  of Shaws</p>
<p>My name is Stewart  he said proudly  Alan Breck they call me And Stewart is a king&#x27;s name so it&#x27;s good enough for me although I have no name of a farmhouse to add to it  He looked around him  Now David I&#x27;ll take any man who comes in through this door You must watch the window  and the door behind me and shoot anyone who tries to enter</p>
<p>He gave me a pistol I was very frightened but tried hard not to show it The ship seemed very quiet Suddenly there was the sound of running feet and a shout and then I heard fighting in the doorway I looked over my shoulder and saw Mr Shuan  just as Alan drove his sword into the officer&#x27;s body Then several men ran at my door I did not want to hurt them but it was now or never I lifted my pistol and shot at them One man fell and the others ran away After a few moments the sailors attacked again Alan fought as bravely as before  his sword now red with blood  He was clearly enjoying himself I had no time to think but when two more men appeared at the window I shot them too Now there were several bodies on the floor and blood everywhere</p>
<p>Suddenly I realized that we had won and that the danger was over Alan was driving the men out of the round-house like sheep When he returned he took me in his arms</p>
<p>David  he cried  I love ye like a brother And oh man am I not a grand fighter  I had to agree He took a knife from the table and cut a silver button off his blue coat  Take this David The buttons come from my father Duncan Stewart where ye show that button the friends of Alan Breck will come to ye  He spoke as proudly as a king and I tried not to smile</p>
<p>We slept in the round-house one of us keeping watch all night and the next morning the captain came to speak to us   Ye&#x27;veve won the fight sir  he said to Alan  We&#x27;re sailing through the Little Minch now and I&#x27;ll keep my promise to take ye to Loch Linnhe But ye&#x27;ve killed my chief officer Shuan and without him I can&#x27;t find my way safely round these rocky coasts We&#x27;ll go round the island of Mull but I warn ye it&#x27;ll be dangerous</p>
<p>Hoseason was right to be worried All that day Alan and I sat in the round-house and told each other the stories of our lives but by night the wind was growing stronger and the sailors found it hard to keep the ship away from the dangerous rocks As we came round Earraid a small island close to the larger island of Mull there was a sudden terrible crash and we realized that the ship had hit a rock There was only one thing to do-leave the ship and try to reach land in the ship&#x27;s boat But as we were climbing down into the boat a great wave hit the ship and knocked some of us into the sea</p>
<p>I went down and came up again several times . Then luckily I managed to find a piece of wood which helped me to stay up in the water I looked round but could not see Alan , or any of the sailors or the boat My only hope was to try to swim to Earraid which I could see not far away in the moonlight It was hard tiring work but I reached it and was very grateful to step on to dry land at last</p>
<p>3 David is alone</p>
<p>It was a cold night so I could not sit down to rest In stead I walked up and down on the beach trying to keep warm There was no sound except the crash of the waves I felt very lonely and afraid</p>
<p>In the morning I climbed a hill and looked out over the sea but there was nothing at all on the water And around me on the island I could not see any houses or people I did not like to think what had happened to my friend Alan and the others and I did not want to look at this emptiness any longer So I climbed down again and walked eastwards I was hoping to find a house where I could dry my clothes and get something to eat  I soon discovered that nobody lived on Earraid It was too far to swim to Mull which could see across the water I thought perhaps I could wade across but when I tried it the water was too deep and I had to turn back By now it had started to rain and I felt very miserable</p>
<p>Then I remembered the piece of wood which had already saved my life once It would help me to get across the sea to Mull So I walked all the way back to the beach where I had arrived The piece of wood was in the sea so I waded into the water to get it But as I came closer it moved away from me And when the water was too deep for me to stand the piece of wood was still several metres away I had to leave it and went back to the beach It was a terrible moment for me I was feeling very tired hungry and thirsty with no hope of getting away from this lonely island For the first time since leaving Essendean I lay down and cried  I do not want to remember the time that I spent on Earraid I had nothing with me except my uncle&#x27;s gold and Alan&#x27;s silver button and as I had never lived near the sea I did not know what to eat or how to fish In fact I found some shellfish among the rocks on the coast and ate them but I was very sick afterwards That was the only food that I could find so I was always hungry on Earraid All day and all night it rained heavily but there was no roof or tree on the island and my clothes were cold and wet on my body</p>
<p>I chose to spend most of my time in the north of Earraid on a little hill From here I could see the old church on the island of Iona not far away to the west and smoke from people&#x27;s houses on Mull to the east I used to watch this smoke and think of the people there and their comfortable lives This gave me a little hope in my lonely life among the rocks and the rain and the cold sea</p>
<p>Two days passed and on the third day two things happened First I discovered that I had lost almost all my money through a hole in my pocket I only had three of my uncle&#x27;s thirty-eight pounds left But worse was to come While I was sitting on a rock looking out over Iona I suddenly noticed a small boat moving fast through the Water I jumped to my feet and shouted as loudly as I could The two men in the boat were near enough to hear They shouted back in Gaelic and laughed But the boat did not turn and sailed on right in front of my eyes to Iona  I could not understand why they did not come to help me I continued shouting wildly although I could no longer see them And then I lay down and cried for the second time This time I wasn&#x27;t sad but angry because I thought that they had left me to die alone in that terrible place</p>
<p>The next morning I was surprised to see that the same men were sailing towards Earraid from Iona At once I ran down to the rocky coast to meet them The boat came near me but stayed a few metres away in the water There was a third man in the boat who was talking and laughing with the others Then he stood up and spoke fast to me in Gaelic which I could not understand But sometimes he used an English word and once I heard the word  tide  This gave me a flash of hope   Do you mean that when the tide is low   I cried and could not finish   Yes yes  he called back  tide  and laughed again  I turned my back on the boat and ran back excitedly to the east of the island where Earraid was the closest to Mull And sure enough there was now only a little water between the is lands I was able to wade through it easily and reached Mull with a happy shout How stupid of me not to realize that it was possible to get to Mull twice a day at low tide Now I felt very grateful to the boatmen for guessing my problem and coming back to help me  I walked towards the smoke that I had seen so often from Earraid and reached a long low house built of stone Outside sat an old man smoking his pipe in the sun He spoke a little English  and told me that the officers and sailors from the ship had all arrived there safely a few days before   Was one of them dressed in fine clothes  I asked   Aye there was one like that  he smiled  Ye must be the lad with the silver button    Why yes  I said surprised   Well then your friend says that ye must follow him to the house of his clansman James Stewart in Appin</p>
<p>He and his wife gave me food and drink and let me sleep that night in their house  In the morning I thanked them for their kindness and started my journey to Appin</p>
<p>I walked across Mull to Torosay where I took a boat across the water to Lochaline Then I walked to Kingairlock where I took another boat across Loch Linnhe to Appin This took six days and on my way I met and spoke to a number of travellers I heard all about Alan&#x27;s clan the Stewarts and their enemies the Campbells Although they were both High land clans the Campbells and Stewarts had hated each other for years and now the Campbells were helping the English army drive many Highlanders out of their homes  Indeed  in a day or two  I heard  red-haired Colin Campbell himself was com ing to Appin  with King George&#x27;s soldiers  to drive the Stew arts out and so destroy his enemies  But I heard also of James Stewart  head of the Stewart clan in Appin  and that he and his clansmen would dearly love to see Colin Campbell dead</p>
<p>People also talked of a man called Alan Breck  Some called him a murderer  others said that he was a brave fighter  He was in danger every time he returned to the Highlands be cause the English would pay a good price for him-dead or alive  I listened with interest to everything that they told me But I liked it best when I heard Alan described as a fine man and an honest Highlander</p>
<p>When I got out of the boat in Appin  I sat down among some trees to decide what to do next  Should I go on  and join Alan  whose friends were King George&#x27;s enemies  and whose life was full of danger or should I go back south again quietly and safely  to the Lowlands</p>
<p>As I was thinking  four men on horses came past me on the road  As soon as I saw these men  I decided to continue my adventure  although I cannot explain why</p>
<p>I stopped the first man  who was tall and red haired</p>
<p>Could you tell me the way to James Stewart&#x27;s house sir  I asked</p>
<p>All the men looked at each other  The red haired man did not reply but spoke to one of the others who looked like a lawyer  Is Stewart calling his people together  do ye think</p>
<p>The lawyer replied  We&#x27;d better wait here for the sold iers to join us  before we go any further</p>
<p>The red haired man I suddenly realized must be Colin Campbell himself  If you&#x27;re worried about me   I said  I&#x27;m not a Stewart  but a Lowlander  and I&#x27;m for King George    That&#x27;s well said   replied Campbell  but  if I may ask why is an honest Lowlander like you so far from his home Today is not a good day for travelling  This is the day when the Appin Stewarts have to leave their farms  and there may be trouble</p>
<p>He was turning to speak to the lawyer again</p>
<p>when there came a sudden bang from the hill  and Campbell fell off his horse  They&#x27;ve shot me   he cried  holding his heart</p>
<p>He died almost immediately  The men&#x27;s faces were white as they looked down at his body I saw something move on the hill and noticed  among the trees  a man with a gun  turning away from the road</p>
<p>Look  The murderer   I cried  and began to run up the hill towards him  He saw me chasing him  and went faster Soon he disappeared behind a rock  and I could no longer see him  I stopped next to some trees  then I heard a voice below on the road</p>
<p>The lawyer was shouting to a large number of redcoated soldiers  who had just joined the men around Campbell&#x27;s dead body  Ten pounds if ye catch that lad   he cried He&#x27;s one of the murderers  He stopped us in the road to give the killer a better chance to shoot Campbell</p>
<p>Now I felt a new kind of fear  My life was in serious danger  although I had not done anything wrong</p>
<p>My mouth felt dry  and for a moment I could not move  I stood there in the open on the hill while the soldiers lifted their guns ready to shoot</p>
<p>Jump in here among the trees   said a voice near me</p>
<p>I did not know what I was doing  but I obeyed  As I did so  I heard the banging of the guns  and realized that the sol diers were shooting at me  In the shadow of the trees  I found Alan Breck standing there  It was he who had spoken to me</p>
<p>4 Escape through the heather</p>
<p>We had no time for conversation  Come   Alan said and started running along the side of the hill  keeping low to the ground  I followed him like a sheep  We ran and ran  faster than I had ever run before  and my heart was beat ing wildly  Sometimes  to my surprise  Alan straightened his back and showed himself to the soldiers who were chasing us</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes  Alan stopped  lay flat in the heather and turned to me  Now   he said  this is serious  Do what I do if ye don&#x27;t want to die  And just as fast but much more carefully and secretly  we went back almost the same way that we had come  At last we arrived back in the wood where I had found Alan</p>
<p>We fell down in the heather  and lay without moving for a long time My legs hurt my head was aching and I thought I was dead</p>
<p>Alan was the first to speak  Well   he said  that was hot work  David</p>
<p>I said nothing  I had seen murder done  I knew that Colin Campbell had been Alan&#x27;s greatest enemy  and I had found Alan hiding in the wood  Although I didn&#x27;t think that he had actually shot Campbell I felt sure that he had planned the killing I coult not look at him</p>
<p>Are ye still tired   he asked</p>
<p>No   I replied  my face turned away from him  no  I&#x27;m not tired now Alan I can&#x27;t stay with you I must leave you I liked you very much  but we&#x27;re two different people that&#x27;s all</p>
<p>Ye must explain what ye mean by that  David   said Alan  looking very serious</p>
<p>Alan  why do you ask  You know very well that Colin Campbell is lying dead in the road in his own blood</p>
<p>Alan was silent for a moment  Well  Mr Balfour of Shaws  he said at last  I promise ye that I did not plan the murder  or know anything about it</p>
<p>Thank God for that   I cried  and offered him my hand</p>
<p>He did not appear to see it I don&#x27;t know why ye&#x27;re so worried about a dead Campbell   he said   I know that you hate their clan  Alan  but taking a life in cold blood is a terrible thing to do Do you know who did it</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recognize him again   said Alan  shaking his head sadly  I&#x27;m good at forgetting David</p>
<p>I had to laugh at that Then I remembered something  But when we were running away  you showed yourself to the sol diers  to give the murderer a chance to escape</p>
<p>Any Highlander would do that  The best place for the lad who shot Colin Campbell is the heather and we must all do what we can to help him keep away from the soldiers</p>
<p>I shook my head at this  These Highlanders were strange wild people  to be sure  But Alan was ready to die for what he thought was right  and I liked him for that  I offered him my hand again  and this time he took it</p>
<p>Now  David   he said  we must escape too  The Campbells will accuse us both of the murder</p>
<p>But we didn&#x27;t do it   I cried  We can prove that in court</p>
<p>Man  I&#x27;m surprised at ye   said Alan  Do ye not know that if a Campbell is killed  the accused has to go to court in Inveraray  in the heart of Campbell country  When the Campbell lawyers have finished with ye ye&#x27;ll be dead</p>
<p>This frightened me a little   All right  Alan   I said   I&#x27;ll go with you</p>
<p>But remember   said Alan  it&#x27;ll be a hard life  Ye&#x27;ll have to sleep in the open air  and ye&#x27;ll often have an empty stomach  Ye can choose-either live in the heather with me or die at the hands of the Campbells</p>
<p>That&#x27;s easy to decide   I said  and we shook hands on it</p>
<p>When we looked between the trees  we could just see the redcoats of the soldiers  still moving away from us across the hills  Alan smiled  and told me that we would go first to the house of his clansman  James Stewart  and then to the Low lands  The Campbells and the English soldiers would not think of looking for us there  and Alan could find a place on a ship sailing to France</p>
<p>We walked for several hours  and arrived that night at a large house in a valley</p>
<p>There were lights in all the windows and people were running in and out of the open doors  Alan whistled three times  and we were met at the door by a tall good-looking man of about fifty  who welcomed us in Gaelic</p>
<p>James Stewart    said Alan  I&#x27;ll ask ye to speak in English  because my friend here comes from the Lowlands and cannot speak Gaelic</p>
<p>James spoke politely to me for a few moments  but soon he turned back to Alan with a very worried look on his face  This is a terrible accident   he said  It will bring trouble to all of us</p>
<p>Well man   said Alan  ye should be grateful that Colin Campbell is dead</p>
<p>Aye   replied James  but he was killed in Appin  remem ber that  Alan  so it&#x27;s the Appin Stewarts who&#x27;ll be accused And I&#x27;m a man with a family</p>
<p>I looked around me  Men with white  frightened faces were hurrying here and there  without any clear idea of what they ought to do first</p>
<p>Some were hiding guns and swords  while others were burning papers  When James saw me looking sur prised  he explained  The soldiers&#x27;ll search my house first ye see  and I don&#x27;t want them to find anything</p>
<p>We went inside  and met James&#x27;s wife and children  who were crying in a corner  I felt very sorry for them  but we did not have much time to talk  Alan explained what we needed for our escape  and soon James&#x27;s men brought us two swords two pistols  some food  a cooking pot and a bottle of whisky We needed money too  because Alan had given his gold to an other man to take to France  But James had only a little to give us</p>
<p>Ye must find a safe place somewhere near   he said   and send me a message  I&#x27;ll find some more money for ye  and send it to ye</p>
<p>But  Alan   and here he stopped for a moment biting his finger worriedly  I&#x27;ll have to accuse ye of killing that Campbell  I&#x27;ll have to If I don&#x27;t  they&#x27;ll accuse me  I have to think of myself and my family Do ye see that</p>
<p>Aye   said Alan slowly  I see that</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ll have to accuse your friend from the Lowlands too Ye see that  Alan  say that ye see that</p>
<p>Alan&#x27;s face went red  It&#x27;s hard on me  James  I brought him here  and now my friends accuse him of murder</p>
<p>But just think Alan man  cried James  The Campbells will be sure to accuse him  And I have children</p>
<p>Well sir   said Alan  turning to me  what do ye say  If ye do not agree I won&#x27;t let James do it</p>
<p>I cannot understand why we don&#x27;t accuse the man who did kill Campbell   I replied sharply  but accuse me  Mr Stewart if you like accuse Alan accuse King George I am Alan&#x27;s friend  and if I can help his friends in any way  I don&#x27;t mind the danger</p>
<p>So that night we started our long journey to the Lowlands Sometimes we walked  and sometimes we ran  But although we travelled as fast as we could daylight began to appear before we had found a good hiding place  We were in the rocky valley of Glencoe  with high mountains on both sides and a river running fast through the middle  Alan was clearly worried  The soldiers will find us easily here   he said  He looked around and saw a great rock about seven metres high  With difficulty we both climbed to the top of it  Then I saw why he had chosen it  The top of the rock was shaped like a plate  and there was room for two or three men to lie there hidden from people in the valley</p>
<p>At last Alan smiled  Aye   he said  Now we have a chance  Ye can sleep for a while  I&#x27;ll watch for soldiers</p>
<p>But when I woke up  several hours later  the valley was full of redcoats  and Alan was looking worried again   If they go up the sides of the mountains they&#x27;ll see us  he said  We&#x27;ll just have to stay here and hope they don&#x27;t  When it&#x27;s dark we&#x27;ll try to get past them</p>
<p>That was a terrible day  We lay on the rock  baking in the sun  with no water only whisky  to drink  We could hear the English voices of the soldiers all around us  but luckily they did not look up at our rock  In the afternoon  when the soldiers seemed sleepy after their lunch  we decided to try to escape  and we climbed very quietly down from the rock  The soldiers did not notice us as we moved carefully from rock to rock  and soon we were safely in the next valley  That evening we washed ourselves in the river  and ate cold porridge  which is a good meal for a hungry man</p>
<p>We continued walking eastwards all night  over the great dark mountains  Alan was very pleased that we had left the soldiers behind  and whistled happily as he walked</p>
<p>Before daylight we reached a cave that Alan had used before  and here we stayed hidden for five days  Alan went down one night to the nearest village  to the housc of one of his clansmen  He sent this man to James Stewart  to tell him where we were hiding  and after three days the clansman re turned  with a purse of money for us and a message from Mrs Stewart  We discovered that James was already in prison  ac cused of murder  although people were saying that Alan Breck had actually fired the shot  And there was a price of one hun dred pounds on my head  as well as on Alan&#x27;s</p>
<p>I began to think that I would be safer alone  Alan was very recognizable in his fine French clothes  It was going to be dan gerous to stay with Alan  and expensive  too  Mrs Stewart had only managed to send five pounds  and Alan had to travel as far as France  But I still had two pounds  and only needed to reach Queensferry  so I would have to give some of my money to Alan  Staying with Alan meant both danger and ex pense</p>
<p>But my honest friend did not think in this way at all  He felt sure that he was helping me  So what could I do  except keep quiet  and hope that everything would be all right</p>
<p>We started travelling again  across the mountains  and by daylight came to wild  open moors  covered with purple heather Because anyone on the hills around us could easily see us when we stood up  we had to walk or run on our hands and feet  like animals It was another hot summer day  and my back achcd badly after a few hours  I wanted a rest and a drink of water  but when we stopped  we saw the redcoats of soldiers on one of the hills  and we had to go on</p>
<p>We walked or ran all day and all night  People who talk of tiredness do not know what the word really means  I did not know who I was or where I was going  and I did not care  I thought that every step would be my last  and I hoped that death would come soon Alan drove me onwards  and I felt that I hated him  but I was too afraid of him to stop and rest</p>
<p>When daylight returned  we were stupid with tiredness and had become careless  Suddenly  three or four wild looking men jumped out of the heather  and took us prisoner I was not afraid  only happy to stop running for a moment  But Alan spoke to them in Gaelic</p>
<p>These are Cluny Macpherson&#x27;s men   he said quietly to me  Ye remember him  the head of the Macpherson clan They fought well against the English in the Forty-Five After that  he didn&#x27;t go to France  like the other clan chiefs No he&#x27;s been hiding here ever since  and the soldiers have never managed to find him  His clansmen bring him what he needs</p>
<p>We were taken to a cave  well hidden by trees and rocks and Cluny Macpherson himself came forward to welcome us like a king in his palace  He seemed to live well in his cave and he offered us an excellent meal  prepared by his cook  But I was too tired to eat  so I lay down at once and slept  In fact although I did not know it  I was seriously ill  and could not get up for two days</p>
<p>I woke up once in a kind of fog  to find Cluny and Alan playing cards  and a second time  to hear Alan asking to borrow my money  I was too sick and sleepy to refuse  and gave him my purse</p>
<p>But when I woke up again  on the third day I felt much better  although not very strong  I noticed that Alan was looking very ashamed  and I realized at once what had hap pened</p>
<p>David   he said miserably  I&#x27;ve lost all our money at cards  yours as well as mine</p>
<p>No no ye haven&#x27;t lost it cried Cluny  Of course I&#x27;ll give your money back  It was just a game  I wouldn&#x27;t keep your money  Here   And he pulled gold coins out of his pocket</p>
<p>I did not know if it was right to accept the money or not but we needed it  so I thanked Cluny and put the coins in my purse  But I was very angry with Alan  and as we left Cluny&#x27;s cave and continued our journey  I refused to speak to him</p>
<p>At first Alan tried hard to talk to me  He said that he was sorry  and that he loved me like a brother  He was worried about my health  and offered me a hand when we crossed a river or climbed a hill But after two or three days when he realized that I was still angry with him  he too became angry and laughed at me when I fell  or seemed tired</p>
<p>We travelled by night  through endless rain and strong winds  and slept in the wet heather by day  I was feeling more and more miserable My illness had returned  and I was beginning to think that this terrible journey would only end in my death  Alan will be sorry when I die   I thought  How childish I was</p>
<p>Alan continued to laugh at me and call me names  and by the sixth night I had had enough I stopped and spoke angrily to him   Mr Stewart   I said   why do you laugh at me I should laugh at you  You may have a king&#x27;s name  but you&#x27;re a loser  You spend your life running away  You&#x27;re not brave enough to fight the Campbells and the English  and win</p>
<p>Alan looked sharply at me  David   he said  There are things that ye should never say things that can never be for gotten</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t like what I say  I&#x27;m ready to fight   I answered stupidly  I knew that I was not strong enough to hold a sword</p>
<p>David   he cried  Are ye crazy  I cannot fight ye  It would be murder   He pulled out his sword  and looked at me  No  I can&#x27;t  I can&#x27;t   he said  And he dropped his sword on the ground</p>
<p>When I saw how much he loved me  I was no longer angry only sick  and sorry I remembered all his kindness to me and how he had always helped me through difficult times Now I had lost that friend for ever  My illness seemed to get worse and worse  and I could only just stand  I wanted to say that I was sorry  but I knew it was too late for that  Suddenly I realized that a cry for help was the only way of bringing Alan back to me</p>
<p>Alan   I said  my voice shaking  If you cannot help me I must just die here  I did not need to pretend</p>
<p>He looked up quickly  surprised  Can ye walk</p>
<p>Not without help Alan if I die will you forget what I said In my heart I&#x27;ve always been your friend you know that</p>
<p>Quiet   cried Alan   Don&#x27;t talk of dying  David  man  ye know   He could not go on  but put his arm around me  Davie  I&#x27;m a bad friend to ye</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t remember that ye&#x27;re just a bairn  I couldn&#x27;t see that ye were dying on your feet  He was almost crying  Hold on to me  Davie  and ye&#x27;ll be grand</p>
<p>He helped me down into the valley to the nearest house which luckily belonged to a clan who were friendly to the Stewarts  There I lay for several days  unable to move  Alan refused to leave me  and took the greatest care of me  Little by little I got better  with his help  and before a month had passed  we went on our way again</p>
<p>This time we did not argue  We did not see any more soldiers  and our journey was easier now  We walked through the warm summer nights  ate our porridge  drank our whisky  and slept in the dry heather in the daytime Now that we were in the Lowlands  we were almost safe  and we both felt happy and hopeful When we crossed the Forth River by boat from Limekilns  we were only five kilometres from Queensferry  where Mr Rankeillor lived</p>
<p>5 David comes home</p>
<p>We decided that Alan would stay hidden in the fields while I walked to Queensferry to find Mr Rankeillor Alan promised not to come out until he heard me return  In order to be sure that it was me  he taught me to whistle a little Gaelic song I have never forgotten it I think that it will run in my head when I lie dying  Every time it comes to me  I think of that last day of my travels  with Alan whistling oppo site me in the grass  while the first light of the sun touched his face</p>
<p>Soon I arrived in Queensferry When I saw people looking strangely at me  and realized how dirty my clothes were  I be gan to feel afraid  Would Mr Rankeillor want to talk to me How could I prove who I was  I had no papers with me  I was too ashamed to ask any of the townspeople for help so I walked up and down not knowing what to do</p>
<p>By midday I was tired and hungry I stopped in front of a large house  with clean windows  flowers in the garden  and a dog sitting on the doorstep</p>
<p>Suddenly the door opened and a large  well-dressed  kind-looking man came out</p>
<p>What are you doing here  my lad   he asked</p>
<p>I&#x27;m looking for Mr Rankeillor&#x27;s house sir  I answered</p>
<p>Well  I&#x27;m Rankeillor and this is my house</p>
<p>Who are you</p>
<p>My name is David Balfour   I replled</p>
<p>David Balfour   he repeated  and looked closely at me  Come inside Mr Balfour and we&#x27;ll talk</p>
<p>In Mr Rankeillor&#x27;s comfortable sitting room  I told him the story of my early life  and explained that my uncle had paid Captain Hoseason to kidnap me and take me to sea</p>
<p>The lawyer listened carefully  I heard that Hoseason&#x27;s ship went down near the island of Mull two months ago   he said</p>
<p>What have you been doing since then</p>
<p>I can easily tell you  sir  I replied  but if I tell you  a friend&#x27;s life may be in danger  Promise me that you will not get him into trouble  or tell the soldiers about him</p>
<p>Although he looked a little worried at first  he promised and I told him the rest of my adventures While I talked  his eyes were closed and he seemed to be asleep  but I discovered soon afterwards that he had understood and remennbered everything</p>
<p>Whem O spoke the name of Alan Breck  he opened his eyes and sat up  Don&#x27;t use unnecessary names  Mr Balfour    he said  A lawyer has to be very careful  when discussing High landers I don&#x27;t think I heard your friend&#x27;s name very well Let&#x27;s call him  Mr Thomson</p>
<p>Of course   I thought  all over Scotland people are talk ing about Alan  now that he&#x27;s accused of the murder of Colin Campbell   I was sure that Rankeillor had recognized his name  But I just smiled  and continued my story  using the name of Mr Thomson instead of Alan Breck   Well  well   said the lawyer  when I had finished   what an exciting adventure  You will have to write it down one day  I had heard of you Mr David from your friends in Essendean  who wrote to me when they had no word from you  Your uncle then told me that he had given you money to study in Europe  but I did not think that was true  I&#x27;m afraid we all know that Ebenezer Balfour is not a very good or honest man  Then Captain Hoseason appeared  saying that you were lost when his ship went down  But now I understand what really happened  and I know that you are David Balfour   He put a hand on my shoulder in a fatherly way and continued  You&#x27;ll want to know about the house of Shaws It&#x27;s a strange story  When they were young  your father Alexander and his younger brother Ebenezer loved the same girl  Your father was always a kind  loving brother  so when the girl decided to marry him  Alexander left Cramond and let Ebenezer have the house and farmland  Well  I think it was a bad mistake  What happened was that your parents were always very poor and Ebenezer became more and more interested in money  He never married of course</p>
<p>Well  sir  I said   and now  what will happen</p>
<p>Now that your father is dead   replied the lawyer  you own the house of Shaws and the farms around it  But Ebenezer won&#x27;t accept that  and it will be expensive if he wants us to prove it in court In fact we must stay out of court if possible The kidnapping will be difficult to prove and we don&#x27;t want people asking questions abut your friend Mr Thomson  No  I think that we should leave Ebenezer at Shaws  where he&#x27;s been for twenty five years  and ask him to pay you some money everyyear  instead of giving you the house What do you think</p>
<p>That sounds excellent to me  sir   I replied   But I think that we could accuse my uncle of kidnapping me  It&#x27;s easier to prove than you think Listen  and I described my plan to him</p>
<p>He was very pleased with it  Yes  Mr David  very good If we can catch Ebenezer like that  he can&#x27;t refuse to give you some of the money that belongs to you   He called to his sec retary  Torrance   You must come with us tonight Torrance  You&#x27;ll have to listen to the conversation you hear and write it all down  And bring the Balfour papers with you   Then he turned to me  But if I accept your plan  Mr David  I&#x27;ll have to meet your friend Mr Thomson  who may be I only say may be a criminal  He was silent for a while thinking deeply  then went on  Well  let&#x27;s talk of something different  Do you know  the other day  I saw Torrance in the street But because I wasn&#x27;t wearing my glasses I didn&#x27;t recognize him  My own secretary  Ha ha ha   and he laughed happily at himself</p>
<p>I smiled politely  Perhaps he&#x27;s getting old  I thought</p>
<p>But later that evening  when Mr Rankeillor  Torrance and I were walking out of Queensferry the lawyer suddenly cried out  laughing  Well  how stupid of me  I&#x27;ve forgotten my glasses  And I understood why he had told met he story about Torrance  Now he could meet Alan  a man wanted for murder  and if the soldiers asked him later for information he could say that he never saw Alan clearly and could not possibly recognize him</p>
<p>When we arrived near Alan&#x27;s hiding place  I whistled the little Highland song  When he appeared  we explained to him what we wanted him to do  and he readily agreed</p>
<p>So the four of us continued walking until we reached the house of Shaws</p>
<p>It was a dark night  and there were no lights in the windows  My uncle was probably in bed  Mr Rankeillor Torrance and I hid below the steps  near enough to hear any conversation  while Alan went straight up to the door and knocked loudly  After some time my uncle opened his bedroom window  and called down  in a frightened voice   What do ye want at this time of night  Who are ye</p>
<p>I do not want to give ye my own name   replied Alan  but I&#x27;ve come to talk to ye about someone called David</p>
<p>What   cried my uncle  And after a moment  he said un happily  Will ye come inside  to discuss the matter</p>
<p>I will not   said Alan sharply  It&#x27;s here on this doorstep that we must talk</p>
<p>Come down and speak to me</p>
<p>After Ebenezer had thought about it  he decided to do what Alan wanted  It took him a long time to come downstairs  and a longer time to unlock the heavr door but at last we saw him in the doorway  holding his gun in his shaking hands</p>
<p>Now   said Alan  ye&#x27;re intelligent enough to see that I&#x27;m a Highlander  I have friends who live near the island of Mull Well  it seems that a ship went down near there  and soon afterwards my friends found a lad  half dead  on the beach Your nephew  Mr Balfour  Since then they&#x27;ve been taking care of him  And now they&#x27;d like to know  Mr Balfour  if ye want him back  Ye&#x27;ll have to pay  if ye do  My friends are very poor</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want him back   said my uncle  He wasn&#x27;t a good lad  I won&#x27;t pay a shilling for him</p>
<p>Blood&#x27;s thicker than water  sir   said Alan  He&#x27;s your brother&#x27;s son  But if ye don&#x27;t want him back  will ye pay us to keep him  And ye&#x27;ll have to hurry  I&#x27;m not waiting here all night</p>
<p>Give me a minute to think  will ye   cried my uncle</p>
<p>In two words  sir  do ye want us to kill or keep the lad</p>
<p>Oh sir   cried Ebenezer  Don&#x27;t talk of killing</p>
<p>Well  killing&#x27;s easier  and quicker  and cheaper</p>
<p>I&#x27;m an honest man   said my uncle  and no murderer</p>
<p>Well  well   replied Alan   and now how much will ye pay for us to keep him  First I need to know how much ye paid Hoseason to kidnap the lad How much was it</p>
<p>Hoseason  Kidnap  What are ye talking about  man   screamed my uncle  jumping up and down on the doorstep</p>
<p>Hoseason himself has told me about it   said Alan calmly  so ye needn&#x27;t pretend Just answer the question or ye&#x27;ll find my sword in your stomach</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get angry   cried my uncle  I gave him twenty pounds  that&#x27;s all  But to be honest with ye he was going to sell the lad as a slave  and keep that money ye see</p>
<p>Thankyou  Mr Thomson that&#x27;s excellent   saidthe lawyer stepping forward  Good evening Mr Balfour</p>
<p>he said politely to the old man</p>
<p>And  Good evening  uncle Ebenezer    said I</p>
<p>And  It&#x27;s a grand evening  Mr Balfour   added Torrance</p>
<p>My uncle said nothing  but stood there on the doorstep with his mouth open  We took him into the kitchen  and sat down to discuss matters  After an hour  it was all decided  My uncle accepted that Shaws belonged to me  but he would stay there during his lifetime  He agreed to pay me money every year and Mr Rankeillor would check that he did</p>
<p>We all stayed that night at the house of Shaws  But while Alan and Torrance and Mr Rankeillor slept on the hard beds upstairs  I lay down on the kitchen chests which now belonged to me  I  who had slept out on the hills for so many days and nights  was now the owner of a large house and several farms</p>
<p>My head was full of exciting plans and ideas and I found it difficult to sleep</p>
<p>The next day  while Mr Rankeillor and I were having breakfast together  I talked to him about Alan</p>
<p>Mr Thomson is still in danger   said the lawyer  He must leave the country as soon as possible  and stay with his friends in France for a while  I&#x27;ll give you money to buy him a place on a ship  He&#x27;ll have to stay hidden until then</p>
<p>And his clansman  James Stewart  who&#x27;s in prison   I asked  I know he didn&#x27;t kill Colin Campbell  I saw the mur derer  I must speak for James Stewart in court</p>
<p>My dear boy   said Rankeillor  it&#x27;s dangerous for anyone to speak for a Stewart in Campbell court  But you must do what you think is right  I&#x27;ll write you a letter to a good lawyer who will be able to help Mr Thomson&#x27;s clansman   He stood up  Well  I think that we&#x27;ve finished our business here  I must leave now and go back to my work</p>
<p>Come and see me often  Mr David  Goodbye</p>
<p>Alan and I started walking towards Edlnburgh while Mr Rankeillor and Torrance turned back to Queensferry  we talked about what would happen next  Alan was going to hide in the countryside near Edinburgh  until it was safe for him to take a ship to France</p>
<p>When I had found him a place I would send him a message  Then I planned to go back to the High lands to help James Stewart return to his family</p>
<p>Alan and I walked slowly  We were both thinking that soon we would have to leave each other  And we had been through so much together We stopped when we came to the top of the Corstorphine Hill  and looked down at Edinburgh  We knew that this was the moment to say goodbye  but we stood there silently for a while</p>
<p>Well  goodbye   said Alan  and held out his hand</p>
<p>Goodbye  I said  and took his hand</p>
<p>Then I went off down hill I did not look back at him but I felt very miserable  and wanted to sit down and cry like a baby</p>
<p>Edinburgh was full of noise and traffic and people  but I did not notice any of that  All the time I was thinking of Alan on the hill  and there was an ice-cold feeling inside me</p>
<p>In the months that followed  I kept Alan&#x27;s silver button safe and often looked at it  remembering our escape through the heather in the wild Highlands  I felt proud to call Alan Breck Stewart my friend  and wondered if I would ever see him again When I returned to the Highlands to help his clansman  James I found that my adventures with the Stewarts were far from finished  but that is another story</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a
