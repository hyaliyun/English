<p>My name is Bess Curle  but this is not my story  It is the story of my lady Mary  Queen of Scots She wrote the story  and then she gave it to me  I am going to give it to her son</p>
<p>She began the story a week ago  It was January 1587  and we sat here in our cold room in Fotheringhay Castle  in the north of England  We couldn&#x27;t see much from the window One or two houses  a river  some trees  some horses  and a road  That&#x27;s all</p>
<p>The road goes to London  the home of Queen Elizabeth of England  Mary sat with her little dog in her hands and watched it  all day long</p>
<p>No one came along the road  Nothing happened  I watched Mary  unhappily</p>
<p>Please  Your Majesty  come away from that window  I said   It doesn&#x27;t help  No one is going to come  Queen Eliza beth can&#x27;t do it Queens don&#x27;t kill Queens</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t they  Bess &#x27;mary said  Then why are we here  in this prison Why am I not free</p>
<p>Why  Your Majesty Because Queen Elizabeth is afraid of you</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right &#x27;mary said  She&#x27;s afraid of me  and she hates me too  She hates me because I am beautiful  and she is not  because I had three husbands  and she never married And because many people good Catnolic people in England France Scotland Spain say that I  Mary  am the true Queen of England  not Elizabeth And Elizabeth has no chil dren  so  when she is dead  my son James</p>
<p>She came away from the window and stood in front of me  James &#x27;she said quietly  my son Does he think about me sometimes  He was only ten months old when I last saw him  It is nearly twenty years</p>
<p>Of course he thinks about you  Your Majesty  I said   You write to him often How can he forget his mother</p>
<p>Then why doesn&#x27;t he write to me &#x27;mary asked  Does he want me to say here in an English prison</p>
<p>No  of course not  Your Majesty  But he has a lot of work  Your Majesty He is the King of Scotland  and</p>
<p>He is not the King of Scotland Bess &#x27;she said  Not be- fore I am dead Remember that</p>
<p>No  Your Majesty  of course not  But perhaps people tell him things that are untrue  You know what people say  Per haps perhaps he thinks you killed his father</p>
<p>Mary&#x27;s face went white She was very angry  and for a minute I was afraid She said  You know that&#x27;s a lie  Bess It is a lie  I did not kill James&#x27;s father I knew nothing about it</p>
<p>I know that Your Majesty But perhaps James doesn&#x27;t know it He hears so many lies  all the time  He needs to know the true story Why don&#x27;t you write  and tell him</p>
<p>Mary sat down slowly  She looked old and tired  All right  Bess &#x27;she said  Give me a pen  please  I&#x27;m going to write to James  and tell him the true story  You can give it to him when I&#x27;m dead</p>
<p>Dead  Your Majesty  Don&#x27;t say that  You aren&#x27;t going to die</p>
<p>Her old  tired eyes looked at me  Yes I am  Bess  You know what is going to happen  One day soon  a man is going to bring a letter from Queen Elizabeth  And then her men are going to kill me  But before I die  I would like to write to my son James  I want to tell him the story of my life So give me a pen  please</p>
<p>I gave her a pen  This is what she wrote</p>
<p>2 France</p>
<p>Dear James  Very soon I am going to die  and meet my God Before I die  I want to write the true story of my life for you  Everything that I write here is true I cannot lie to you  or to God  Please believe that  James  It&#x27;s impor- tant to me</p>
<p>My father died when I was one week old  so I was the Queen of Scots when I was a baby  At first I lived with my mother in Scotland  and then  when I was five  I went to France  My mother was French  but she stayed in Scotland  and died there</p>
<p>I went to France to marry the King of France&#x27;s son  His name was Francis  and he was one year younger than me  In 1559  his father died  so Francis was King  Then I was Queen of France  and Queen of Scotland too</p>
<p>I was very happy in France  Francis  my husband  was like a little brother to me  I think he loved me  bur he was very young and he was often ill And then in 1560 he died He was sixteen years old</p>
<p>When he died I was very unhappy  and my life was very different  There was a new King and Queen  and I wasn&#x27;t important in France  any more  But I was still Queen of Scots  so I came back to Scotland  When I arrived in Scotland  I was a young girl of eighteen  My mother was dead  and there was no one there to meet me  I walked off the ship and I slept in a little house near the sea</p>
<p>Next day  the Scots lords came from Edinburgh  They were pleased to see me  and for a week everyone was happy  People smiled at me and sang in the streets  I think everyone liked me  Then  that Sunday  I went to church</p>
<p>James  my son  you are a Protestant and I am a Catholic You are a good man  and you love God  but your church and my church are enemies  I was born a Catholic  and I am going to die a Catholic  I love God  too I hope you understand that  I&#x27;m not going to change now</p>
<p>That Sunday  people shouted angrily in the streets  Your Majesty &#x27;said the Scots lords  Scotland is a Protestant coun-try  You can&#x27;t go to a Catholic church here  The Scottish people don&#x27;t like Catholics</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry  my lords  I said  But I am your Queen no one tells me what to do I don&#x27;t hate Protestants and I&#x27;m not going to kill them  The people can go to their Protestant churches  and pray to God there  But I&#x27;m going to pray with Catholics  in my church</p>
<p>People were angry because of that  A man called John Knox came to see me  He was a famous Protestant churchman  but I didn&#x27;t like him  He was a big  angry man with black clothes He hated the Catholic church  and wanted all Catholics to leave Scotland  To him  the Protestant church was the only true church of God  He said  Your Majesty  you&#x27;re a young woman  like my daughter  Women can&#x27;t understand difficult 10things like God or the church  Find a good Protestant husband girl  Let him rule this country for you</p>
<p>I was very angry with this man Knox  I was a Queen  but I was only eighteen  He didn&#x27;t talk quietly he shouted at me I cried because of his angry words  I could not understand him he talked so much  and he knew so many books  But I did not go to his church</p>
<p>He was right about one thing  Perhaps I could rule Scotland without a man  but I could not have a child without one  And every Queen needs a son or daughter to come after her So I began to look for a husband</p>
<p>3 Darnley and Riccio</p>
<p>At first I wanted to marry the son of the King of Spain Don Carlos  But he was a Catholic  of course  and my Scots lords did not like that  It was difficult for me  James  I wanted to please myself  I wanted to please my friends and family in France and to please my people  too  And then there was the Queen of England</p>
<p>At first I wanted very much to be friends with Elizabeth We wrote many letters  and talked about a meeting a meet-ing between two sister Queens Elizabeth wrote to me at this time</p>
<p>Our two countries need to be friends You need a husband I need a friend Why not marry my friend Robert Dudley the Earl of Leicester He is a tall strong man  I think he could be a good husband for you</p>
<p>I was very angry about this letter There were a lot of sto ries about Elizabeth and Robert Dudley They were good friends he often danced and sang and talked with her  Some times people said  he stayed in her room all night  Dudley had a wife  but one day she died very suddenly  It was an ac-cident she fell down the stairs  they say  But then  perhaps she was unhappy  because of her husband and Elizabeth</p>
<p>And she writes to me about a man like this  I thought  She wants him to marry me  because he is her friend her lover perhaps She wants her lover to be King of Scotland</p>
<p>I found a better man than Dudley  James  I found Henry Darnley  your father</p>
<p>He was nineteen years old  and I was twenty three He was a tall man  with a beautiful face and big green eyes  He talked and sang well  and I liked dancing with him  He often wore expensive black clothes  and he laughed a lot when he was with me  He was very young and friendly  and I felt happy when I was with him  I liked him very much  and I thought he loved me too</p>
<p>He was an important man  too We were cousins his grandfather was King of Scots  and his great-grandfather was Henry VII of England</p>
<p>In July 1565  I married him  Elizabeth was very angry  and so were a lot of the Scots lords  My half brother  the Earl of Moray  tried to stop the marriage  I had to fight him  and he ran south  to England But I was happy Your father and I laughed  every day  He was now Henry  King of Scots</p>
<p>After one or two weeks  the laughter stopped  A King has a lot of work  James  you know that  He has to read hundreds of letters  talk to people  and think about a lot of important things I did those things every day But now I thought I had a man to help me</p>
<p>My lord Henry  I said  Would you like to read all the letters with me  You can sit next to me  and you can work with me every day</p>
<p>Your father looked unhappy  I&#x27;m not interested in work like that  he said  I don&#x27;t understand it</p>
<p>Of course not  I said  You&#x27;re a young man  my love But I can teach you</p>
<p>For one or two days he sat down with me  and I tried to teach him  But it was true  he was not interested in the work and he did not try to understand it</p>
<p>You do it  Mary  he said  I&#x27;m going out with my friends  We&#x27;re going to ride  and drink  and swim</p>
<p>So I did all the work  At night  too  he often went out with his friends in the town  They drank a lot  and laughed and sang  and there were often fights  But no one said anything because he was the King  my husband  What could people say  They were unhappy  but they were afraid of him  Some of them went to England  to the Earl of Moray</p>
<p>At this time I was often very tired  because I was pregnant You  my son James  were alive inside me  But I did all the work of a Queen and I needed friends too One of these friends was a young Italian  David Riccio</p>
<p>Riccio was a little man and he was not tall or beautiful or strong  But he was a very clever  interesting man  He wrote many of my letters for me  and helped me  He sang well  too and I sometimes sang with him in the evenings  I liked him very much and at first your father liked him too</p>
<p>But then  Moray&#x27;s friends began to talk about me and Ric cio  David Riccio is in the Queen&#x27;s rooms every night &#x27;they said to your father  She laughs and sings and dances with him  my lord it is not right  He is not a Scotsman  and he is not her husband  He is always with her</p>
<p>Perhaps they said other things too I don&#x27;t know A lot of Scots lords listened to them  But I tell you  James  before God  I did nothing wrong  David Riccio was a good man  He worked hard  and he helped me so of course I liked him Your father did not work he went out to the town every night with his friends and drank</p>
<p>And then one night  your father came home</p>
<p>4 The death of David Riccio</p>
<p>It was a Saturday evening in March 1566  I was in Edin burgh with some friends  David Riccio was there  with six or seven other people  We were in a small room  but there was a good dinner on the table  and we were happy  It was dark outside  but inside it was warm and friendly</p>
<p>Suddenly  a door opened behind me  In the door was Henry Darnley my husband I stood up and smiled</p>
<p>Good evening  my lord  I said  Please come in  Would you like something to eat</p>
<p>No  thank you  he said  I&#x27;m not hungry But I want to sit next to you  wife  Please tell that man to move</p>
<p>A man got out of the chair next to me and Darnley sat beside me Then he put his arms round me  I did not like it  His face was hot  and his eyes looked unhappy  But I smiled and said  I&#x27;m happy to see you  my lord</p>
<p>Are you  Mary  He laughed  Are you really</p>
<p>Yes  of course  my lord  But</p>
<p>Then the second door opened and his friend  Lord Ruthven stood there He had a knife in his hand  His face was red  and he looked very angry</p>
<p>Af first no one moved  Then Ruthven said  Your Majesty send David Riccio out of this room  now  I want him</p>
<p>I looked at Riccio  He was afraid  Why  I said  Why do you want him</p>
<p>He is a bad  wicked man  Ruthven said  Send him out</p>
<p>No  I said  You want to kill him  David Riccio is my friend  He stays here  with me</p>
<p>He goes out  woman  Lord Ruthven said   King Henry hold your wife  please</p>
<p>I stood up  but Darnley held my arms and I could not move David Riccio ran behind me and held my dress  My friends in the room stood up too  and moved towards Ruthven angrily But he had a knife in his hand</p>
<p>Get back  he said angrily  Don&#x27;t touch me</p>
<p>Then five men with knives ran into the little room  and there was a fight  One man held a knife in my face  and an other man hit David Riccio  behind me  Then they pulled him out of the room</p>
<p>Help me  he screamed  Help me  my Queen please They&#x27;re going to kill me Don&#x27;t aaaaaargh</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t help him  because Darnley had me in his arms But I could hear David Riccio&#x27;s screams  I think he fell down the stairs  and he screamed for two or three minutes  Then it was quiet</p>
<p>What are you doing  I asked Darnley angrily  Riccio is a good man why are you doing this</p>
<p>Darnley laughed  You are my wife  Mary not David Ric cio&#x27;s  he said  so why are you with him every evening You never talk to me</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t talk to you because you are never here  I said  You are always drinking with your friends  You aren&#x27;t a king  you&#x27;re a stupid boy</p>
<p>He laughed again  It was not a nice laugh  Well  he said  Perhaps I am a boy  but that is better than David Riccio now Do you want to go and see him</p>
<p>I did see him  five minutes after that  He was very dead and there was blood all over the floor  Poor David Riccio  He sings to God now  not me</p>
<p>I looked at Henry Darnley  my husband  He had a stupid smile on his face  But I think he was afraid of me I looked at him a long time  and the smile went away</p>
<p>Remember this night husband  I said to him  Remem ber it well Think about it when you look into my eyes  and before you go to sleep  David Riccio was my friend  and you killed him in front of me  I&#x27;m never going to forget that Henry Darnley  Never</p>
<p>5 My son is born</p>
<p>Next morning  Darnley came to see me  He was afraid  What&#x27;s the matter husband  I said  Why are you crying</p>
<p>Oh Mary  Mary  he said   I&#x27;m sorry  I was wrong I helped those men to kill Riccio  and now the Earl of Moray is back here with them He hates me I am afraid they&#x27;re going to kill me  and you too  Think of our child  Mary  here inside you</p>
<p>He took me in his arms again I was very angry  I am sorry  James  that this man was your father  He was a stupid boy  not a man  He was tall and strong and beautiful but he could never think like a man or a king</p>
<p>I said   You know these men  Henry  What do they want</p>
<p>They they want our child  Mary  They don&#x27;t want us They&#x27;re going to put you in prison  They don&#x27;t want you to be Queen they want your child to be King or Queen  I I don&#x27;t know what they want to do with me</p>
<p>Perhaps they want you to be King  too  without me  I said quietly  Then you can do what they say  like a little boy</p>
<p>Perhaps Mary They said that yesterday But now that Moray&#x27;s here I don&#x27;t know  I&#x27;m afraid  Please help me  He began to cry again  What can we do</p>
<p>We can run away  I said  We can leave Edinburgh quick ly and quietly  before Ruthven and his men stop us  Be quiet for a minute  I want to think</p>
<p>I walked up and down for two or three minutes  then I said  Henry  go back to these men  Tell them</p>
<p>No  Mary  please  I can&#x27;t  I&#x27;m afraid of them</p>
<p>Listen to me Henry And try to be a man  Go and tell them I&#x27;m ill  because of the child Say I&#x27;m not angry with them  Tell them anything lie to them  Then  tonight  bring some men and horses here  behind the castle</p>
<p>He went  and did it All day I waited in my rooms  and lis tened  Then  at one o&#x27;clock in the morning  Darnley and I went quietly down the stairs behind the castle Some of my friends were there  with horses for us  Quickly  we rode away into the night</p>
<p>That was a very bad night  It was dark and cold  I was ill and Darnley was afraid  Come on  he said  Ride faster woman  You&#x27;re too slow</p>
<p>But I was pregnant  and it was cold and dark  We rode for five bours in the rain  I can&#x27;t  Henry  I said  I&#x27;m ill Think of the baby  I don&#x27;t want it to die</p>
<p>Why not  he said   We can always make another one</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry  but it is true  Your father said things like that James Then he rode away in front of me  into the dark  I rode slowly behind  with my good woman  Bess Curle</p>
<p>In the morning we arrived at Dunbar Castle  Darnley slept and I wrote letters to my friends  Next day Lord Bothwell came to help me  I liked him he was a good  strong man Soon I had an army of 8 000 men  Bothwell and I rode back to Edinburgh with the army  Lord Ruthven died  and some of his friends ran away  But the Earl of Moray stayed</p>
<p>All that summer I ruled the country  and waited for the ba-by  My husband stayed outside my rooms  I did not want to see him  No one did  Perhaps he drank with his friends  I don&#x27;t know</p>
<p>And then  on 19th June  in a small room in Edinburgh Cas tle  my baby was born  It took a long time  but at last you were in my arms  James  my son</p>
<p>I asked your father to come in  My Lord Henry  I said  This is our baby  Look at him  my Lord  Take him in your arms  He is your son isn&#x27;t he beautiful</p>
<p>But your father did not love me  James  Very often  after you were born  he slept with other women  I know that be cause he talked to everyone about it  I think he wanted people to know  And I am sorry  but I do not think he loved you James  When I took you to church and gave you your name he did not come  He wasn&#x27;t interested</p>
<p>But because of him  David Riccio was dead  I could never forget that Never</p>
<p>6 Kirk O Field</p>
<p>I had a new man to help me now The Earl of Bothwell a strong clever man  He was older than me he was not a boy like Darnley  He worked hard and he could think  He was a good fighter and he was not afraid of other men  Per haps you are like him  James  my son</p>
<p>In January your father Darnley was ill in Glasgow I went to see him  and took him back to Edinburgh  He was unhappy  and afraid of people  He saw enemies behind every door  Poor stupid boy  He said he loved me again  I was an gry  but I felt sorry for him  too  He was very ill</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not far now  Henry  I said  You can sleep in the castle</p>
<p>No  not there  please  Mary  he said  I don&#x27;t want to go into the castle  I&#x27;m afraid of it</p>
<p>But where do you want to go  I asked</p>
<p>Find me a little house outside the town  and stay with me there  he said  We can be happy there</p>
<p>So I found him a small house called Kirk o Field outside Edinburgh  He stayed there  in a room upstairs  and some times I slept in a room downstairs  Darnley was often afraid and I visited him every day  Slowly  he got better</p>
<p>On Sunday 9th February  there was a big wedding in Ed inburgh  After the wedding  Bothwell and I walked out to Kirk o Field to see Darnley and talk to him  Everyone sang and laughed  and was very happy</p>
<p>At ten o&#x27;clock I was tired  Good night  my lords  I said</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going downstairs to bed</p>
<p>Lord Bothwell put his hand on my arm  Your Majesty  he said  You can&#x27;t sleep here now Don&#x27;t you remember Peo ple are dancing and singing in town tonight everyone wants you to go</p>
<p>Oh  yes  I forgot  I said  Of course  people want to see me there  So  good night  Henry  Sleep well</p>
<p>Darnley was very unhappy  Please  Mary my love  don&#x27;t go  he said  Don&#x27;t leave me here</p>
<p>But I did not love him now  I remembered the night when Riccio died So I smiled and said  Good night Henry Be a man now don&#x27;t be afraid of the dark</p>
<p>Then I went downstairs with Lord Bothwell  Outside the house  we met one of Bothwell&#x27;s men  He looked afraid  and there was something black on his face and hands</p>
<p>Jesus  man  how dirty you are  I said  Don&#x27;t come near me with those hands</p>
<p>No  my lady  of course not  he said  He looked at Both well for a minute  and then ran away quickly  I laughed  got on my horse  and forgot about it</p>
<p>I tell you before God  James  I did not kill your father It was not me  I knew nothing about it nothing</p>
<p>I sang and danced in town  and then went to bed in Edin burgh Castle  Then  at two o&#x27;clock in the morning  there was a sudden noise a very big BANG  Everybody heard it all through the town</p>
<p>My God  I said  What&#x27;s that</p>
<p>Everyone ran out of their rooms Lord Bothwell was down stairs  Don&#x27;t be afraid  ladies  he said  My men are out side they&#x27;re going to see what it is</p>
<p>After an hour he came to see me  Please sit down  my lady  he said  I have some unhappy news</p>
<p>Yes my lord What is it</p>
<p>It&#x27;s your husband  Lord Darnley  He is dead</p>
<p>But how  How did he die  Who killed him</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know  my lady That bang that was his house Kirk o Field  It&#x27;s not there any more</p>
<p>What  And Darnley was inside</p>
<p>Well  no  my lady  Bothwell said slowly  My men found him in the garden  not in the house  He is wearing only night clothes  and there is no blood on him  But he is dead  I am sorry</p>
<p>Take me out there  I want to see him now</p>
<p>Yes  my lady</p>
<p>I went out to Kirk o Field in the early morning  There was no house now no walls  no doors  no windows nothing And there in the garden  a long way from the house  was that poor dead boy  my husband</p>
<p>I did not love him but I cried then  He was your father James  and I did not kill him  I don&#x27;t know who killed him but he had many enemies in Scotland</p>
<p>I was very afraid I  too  had enemies  and I often slept there  Perhaps someone wanted to kill me  too</p>
<p>7 Bothwell</p>
<p>Soon everyone in Europe heard the news  The Queen of France and the Queen of England wrote angry letters to me  Who killed the King  they asked  I was very unhappy at this time  James  We looked for the killers  but we could not find them  Please believe me  James  The Scots lords are difficult men  Some were friends  some were enemies  but they changed all the time</p>
<p>Many people in Scotland said  Bothwell killed Lord Darn ley  I heard them  outside the castle  and in the town  But I never believed it  People in Edinburgh sold horrible stories and pictures of Bothwell the same day that Darnley died  It was too soon  Perhaps Darnley&#x27;s killers wrote these stories about Bothwell  before they killed Darnley</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think Lord Bothwell killed your father James  He was a good friend to me in difficult times  He was a good strong  clever man  and he worked hard  I liked that  A lot of women liked him I think</p>
<p>Three times that spring  he asked me to marry him  He had a wife  and I could not marry again  so soon  I asked him to wait</p>
<p>Then  on24th April  I rode out of Edinburgh to the north I had five or six friends with me Six miles outside the town Lord Bothwell met us  with an army</p>
<p>Why are you here my lord  I said</p>
<p>He smiled   Because I want to meet you  Mary  he said  I want you to come with me to my castle  He rode next to me  and his men rode between me and my friends</p>
<p>I was afraid and a little excited too  But my lord you can&#x27;t do this  I said  I don&#x27;t want to come with you now</p>
<p>But I want you  Mary  he said  Your friends can&#x27;t stop me  I love you  and I want to marry you  What&#x27;s wrong with that</p>
<p>I said nothing What could I say I liked him and he had an army  I had only six friends So I rode with him to his cas tle in Dunbar  and stayed there two weeks  And then  He was a strong man  and I was only a woman  And I did like him  James  I liked him very much</p>
<p>After two weeks in Dunbar  Bothwell and I rode back to Edinburgh  His wife did not want him  and was happy to di vorce him So on 15th May 1567  I married him</p>
<p>He was a good man  James  A much better man than your father  I needed a strong man to help me rule the country</p>
<p>But I was wrong  I understand that now  All the Scots lords were afraid of Bothwell  and many of them were his ene-mies  They had an army  and on 15th June Bothwell and I rode out to fight them</p>
<p>We met them at Carberry Hill  It was a hot day  and the two big armies stood  and looked  and waited  Their army had a big flag with a picture of your poor dead father Darnley  on it  Under the picture  there were the words  Find my killers  oh God</p>
<p>Come on  my lord  I said to Bothwell  Our army is bet ter than theirs let&#x27;s fight them</p>
<p>Both well rode up and down  and talked to his men  But they didn&#x27;t want to fight  They talked  and looked at the flag  and waited  Then some of them walked home</p>
<p>At five o&#x27;clock that evening Lord Kirkcaldy rode from his army to talk to us  He said to me  My lady  leave your hus-band  and come with us We don&#x27;t want men to die</p>
<p>And so  because our men didn&#x27;t want to fight  I went with him  It was a very bad day for me  They took me back to Ed inburgh  and people in the streets screamed at me  Kill the woman  She sleeps with her husband&#x27;s killer We want James to be King  Kill her now</p>
<p>I was unhappy  and afraid  and I was pregnant again They took me to Lochleven Castle  and put me in a room like a prison There  I did not eat for two weeks  and Bothwell&#x27;s children there were two babies wer born dead I nearly died too I was so angry and tired and ill  Then  one day after the babies died  Lord Lindsay gave me a letter  It said</p>
<p>I Mary  Queen of Scots  give the kingdom of Scotland to my son  James From today  James is the new King of Scots But because he is a child  the Earl of Moray  my half brother  can rule the country for him</p>
<p>Because I was afraid  and tired  and ill  I wrote my name on the letter Mary  But it is not important James it doesn&#x27;t change anything I am Queen of Scots  not you  That letter changes nothing</p>
<p>Bothwell went over the sea  and died in a prison in Denmark  I was a prisoner in Lochleven for a year  A lot of people in Europe were angry about that  Queen Elizabeth wrote to the Earl of Moray  You cannot keep a Queen in prison &#x27;she said  It is very wrong  I was pleased about that But Moray didn&#x27;t listen</p>
<p>Lord Douglas lived in the castle  and his young son William liked me  One day  there was a wedding in the castle  People sang and danced and drank  William Douglas gave me some old women&#x27;s clothes  I put the clothes on  and walked quietly out of the castle with him  He shut the castle door behind us  to keep his father&#x27;s friends in  Then we got on some horses  and rode away through the night</p>
<p>All my friends came back to me  Soon I had a big army  Mary is our Queen again  people said  Give her back her son  You were in Earl Moray&#x27;s castle  James  so I came to fight him  I rode with my army to Langside  near Glasgow And there</p>
<p>There  James</p>
<p>There  my son  I lost the fight  I am so sorry  I had many good  strong men in my army  but Earl Moray&#x27;s men were stronger  Many of my men died  and some ran away  After the fight  I ran away too</p>
<p>I did not want to go to prison again  So I rode south  to England  Queen Elizabeth wants to help me  I thought  She understands She wrote to Moray and she is a Queen like me I can come back to Scotland with her army  kill Moray  and find my baby son James I am in England but I am free I can try again</p>
<p>I was wrong about that  too  Very wrong</p>
<p>8 England</p>
<p>Elizabeth didn&#x27;t give me her army She put me in prison You know this James it is the story of your life not mine  I was twenty five years old when I came to England  and I am forty five now Twenty years in English prisons</p>
<p>Moray told lies about me  Mary and Bothwell killed Darn ley  he said Mary slept with Riccio and Bothwell and killed her husband  But it&#x27;s not true They&#x27;re all lies  James  wicked lies They only said these things because I am a woman  and a Catholic  and they don&#x27;t want a Catholic queen in Scotland  they want a Protestant king</p>
<p>A king like you  James Why  James my son  don&#x27;t you help me  Why are you friendly with Elizabeth  my enemy You don&#x27;t want me back in Scotland  do you  You believe these lies  don&#x27;t you You talk to Moray and his friends  every day But they lied about me James Moray and his friends killed Riccio Then killed your father  too They stole my husband Bothwell  stole my son</p>
<p>Stole my son&#x27;s love</p>
<p>I am sorry  James Forgive me Sometimes I get very angry It is difficult not to be angry  when you are in prison for twenty years</p>
<p>Elizabeth didn&#x27;t know what to do Sometimes she believed Moray  sometimes she didn&#x27;t She was afraid to kill me  be-cause I was a Queen  She was afraid to let me go free  bcause I have friends in England  The English Catholics want me to be Queen of England  not her  And she is a woman with no husband and no son  so she hates me  too</p>
<p>Sometimes the English Catholics write to me and ask me for help  and sometimes I write to them Sometimes Elizabeth&#x27;s men find these letters  The English Protestants want to kill me because of these letters  You are a wicked woman &#x27;they say   You killed your husband  Darnley  and now you want to kill our Queen Elizabeth You&#x27;re going to die</p>
<p>I did not kill my husband  I said  And when l came to England  I did not want to kill your Queen  I asked her for help I wanted to go back to Scotand But my lords she put me in prison for twenty years  Twenty years  my lords I want to be free don&#x27;t you understand that  when men write to me and try to help me  then yes  sometimes I write back Why not  Is that wicked  do you think</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t listen  Of course not  They want to kill me And so they wrote to Queen Elizabeth  And now I sit here  in Fotheringhay Castle  and wait for her to answer  I do not want to die  James my son  but I do not want to live all my life in an English prison  I am old  and tired of life  Think well of me  James  my son  and</p>
<p>9 A death</p>
<p>Queen Mary stopped writing then  Yesterday afternoon 7th February 1587  we heard a horse outside our win-dow  Mary looked out  There was a man there  on the road from London  He had a letter from the Queen of England</p>
<p>In the evening  an Englishman  Lord Shrewsbury came to see Mary  I am sorry my lady  he said  But I have a letter from my Queen  You&#x27;re going to die  tomorrow</p>
<p>Mary did not move  When &#x27;she asked quietly</p>
<p>At half past eight in the morning  he said  I am very sorry  my lady  He went away</p>
<p>We did not sleep much that night We talked and prayed to God  and she gave me her letter to her son  James  Give it to him  Bess  please &#x27;she said  And tell him how I died</p>
<p>Yes  my lady  I said  And so now I am going to tell you King James This is how your mother died</p>
<p>At six o&#x27;clock she got up prayed  and dressed  She put on a red petticoat first  then a black dress  and a white veil over the dress  The veil came from her head to her feet  she could see out through it  but we could not see her face  She looked like a woman on her wedding day</p>
<p>When the Englishmen came we went downstairs with her Her little dog walked beside her  under the veil  but the Eng lishmen didn&#x27;t see that  Six of us went into a big room with her  A hundred people stood and watched</p>
<p>A Protestant churchman came to talk to her  My lady  he said  Pray with me</p>
<p>No &#x27;she said  Thank you  but no  I was born a Catholic and I&#x27;m going to die a Catholic  I think God understands that &#x27;she prayed for five minutes  and then stood up  The executioner came towards her  He was a big  strong man with an axe  and something black over his face</p>
<p>I am sorry  my lady  he said  I don&#x27;t hate you  but this is my work  Please forgive me</p>
<p>Of course I forgive you &#x27;mary said  I am old  and tired and you&#x27;re going to open my prison doors for me  I am going to see God Do your work well</p>
<p>Then she looked at me and her friends  Don&#x27;t cry for me ladies &#x27;she said  Please  don&#x27;t cry now</p>
<p>She could not walk to the block  so the executioner helped her  He took off her white veil  and then he took off her black dress  and put it on the floor  She stood there  in her red pet-ticoat with a smile on her face  Then the executioner put something over her eyes  Very slowly  Mary put her head on the block</p>
<p>The Lord my God is my one true friend &#x27;she said  I give my life oh God into your hands</p>
<p>Then the executioner lifted his axe  once  twice  oh God three times and her head her poor poor head fell on the floor</p>
<p>It was very quiet in the room after that  It is a little thing a head a very little thing  But there was so much blood blood on her red petticoat  blood on her black dress and her white veil  blood on the executioner&#x27;s shoes  blood all over the floor  Blood  blood everywhere</p>
<p>We all looked  and said nothing  The executioner put down his axe and stood quietly  And then Mary&#x27;s little dog came out from under her bloody dress and veil  and walked slowly  un-happily  through the blood towards her head</p>
<p>My lord the story of your poor mother&#x27;s life finishes here We  her friends  cry for her  but that is how your mother died  She died like a Queen  A good lady and a famous Queen</p>
<p>Mary  Queen of Scots</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a
