<p>In the early years of the nineteenth century Strange-looking little men were often seen on the country roads usually with a heavy bag on their shoulders They were linen weavers taking the linen they had woven to the women in the villages Unlike the strong healthy country people they were small and thin with tired white faces bent backs and round shoulders They were often shortsighted too because they had to look so closely at their work To the villagers the weavers looked almost foreign and quite frightening Where did they come from Was it the devil who sent them Who were their parents How could you trust a man if you didn&#x27;t know his father or mother Country people used to be very suspicious of all strangers and travellers They were also suspi-cious of clever people people who could do something they themselves had not learnt to do That is why the linen weavers who often moved from towns to live and work in the country were considered strangers all their lives by their neighbours and were sometimes very lonely as a result.</p>
<p>Silas Marner was one of these weavers He lived in a small cottage near the village of Raveloe Every day he worked at his loom in the cottage The small boys of Raveloe had never heard the sound of a loom before and sometimes they used to run up to his house to look quickly in at the window If Silas noticed them he lifted his shortsighted eyes from the loom to stare at the boys There was something terrible about his stare which made the boys run away at once screaming with fear The vil lagers believed that Silas had an almost devilish power which he could use to harm them if he wanted and so they were all afraid of him Raveloe was an important looking village with a fine old church and a number of large farms But it was at least an hour away from any other village and very few strangers visited it which explains why the villagers opinions were so out of date</p>
<p>Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe fifteen years before as a young man He and his way of life seemed very strange to the villagers He worked long hours at his loom and had no friends or visitors from the village or anywhere else He never talked to his neighbours unless it was necessary for his work and he never looked at any of the Raveloe girls  Who would want to marry him anyway &#x27;the girls laughed to each other  Marry a dead man come to life again with that unhealthy white skin and those insect like eyes of his Certainly not</p>
<p>One of the villagers had had a strange experience with Silas One evening he had discovered the weaver resting on a field gate his eyes open but unseeing and his body cold and hard like a dead man&#x27;s After a few moments Silas appeared to wake up said Good night  and walked away</p>
<p>When this was discussed in the village some people thought that Silas had had a fit But others like Mr Macey the church clerk refused to accept a medical explanation</p>
<p>No he isn&#x27;t ill that weaver &#x27;said old Mr Macey shaking his head knowingly  If he had a fit he&#x27;d fall down wouldn&#x27;t he I think his soul flies out of his body sometimes and that&#x27;s why he looks so strange He doesn&#x27;t come to church does he And how does he know so much about medicines You all re member how he made Sally Oates better when the doctor him-self could do no more for her That&#x27;s the devil&#x27;s work believe me</p>
<p>However the housewives needed Silas to weave their linen and they could find nothing wrong with his work The years passed and Raveloe villagers did not change their opinion of the weaver At the end of fifteen years they said exactly the same things about him but they believed them more strongly They also said that he had saved up a lot of money since he had come to Raveloe</p>
<p>Silas had come from a large town to the north of Raveloe Here he had lived a very different life Because he was one of a large number of weavers he was not considered strange and he belonged to an enthusiastic religious group They met every Sunday at the chapel in Light Street Once at a chapel meeting Silas had become unconscious and had sat without moving hearing or seeing for over an hour This experience made him specially interesting to the rest of the group</p>
<p>We should not call this strange unconsciousness a fit &#x27;the minister Mr Paston told them  No  it&#x27;s much more than that In that moment when he is absent from us our young friend Silas&#x27;s soul is open open to a possible message from God I believe he has been chosen by God</p>
<p>silas&#x27;s best friend at chapel was William Dane a serious young man who was some people thought a little too sure of his own goodness and cleverness Silas however could see no fault in him and trusted his friend completely They remained good friends when Silas became engaged to a young woman Sarah who belonged to the same chapel In fact Silas was de lighted that Sarah did not mind if William joined them some times on their Sunday walks</p>
<p>Strangely when Silas had his fit at the chapel meeting William was the only one who disagreed with the minister</p>
<p>To me it looks more like the devil&#x27;s work than God&#x27;s  William had said  Look deep into yourself friend Silas Is there any evil hiding in your soul</p>
<p>Silas was hurt that his friend doubted him and he began to be worried too about Sarah She seemed to be showing signs of dislike towards him but when he asked her about it she did not give him any answer</p>
<p>At that time one of the chapel leaders was dangerously ill and because he had no family some of the young men offered to sit with him at night One night Silas was sitting alone at the old man&#x27;s bedside Time seemed to pass slowly in the quiet dark room But suddenly he realized that the man was no longer breathing He was dead</p>
<p>Strange &#x27;thought Silas  His body&#x27;s cold He&#x27;s been dead for some time Why did&#x27;t I notice Perhaps I&#x27;ve had anoth er fit And it&#x27;s already four o&#x27;clock in the morning Why hasn&#x27;t William come He promised he&#x27;d come at two o&#x27;clock  He hurried out of the house to call the doctor and the minister and then went to work as usual still wondering why William had not arrived</p>
<p>But that evening after work William came to his room with the minister They were both looking very serious</p>
<p>You must come to the chapel at once &#x27;said Mr Paston</p>
<p>But why  asked Silas looking unhappily at them</p>
<p>You will hear when you get there was the only answer</p>
<p>Then in the chapel Silas stood alone in front of all the peo ple who were once his friends The room was silent There was a pocket knife in the minister&#x27;s hand</p>
<p>Where did you leave this knife  he asked</p>
<p>Silas was trembling at this strange question I don&#x27;t re member  he answered</p>
<p>Silas Silas you must confess  cried the minister  Tell us the truth This knife your knife was found at the dead man&#x27;s bedside and the bag of church money which I saw there myself only yesterday has gone</p>
<p>Silas did not speak for a moment Then he said  God knows I did not steal the money Search my room you won&#x27;t find the money I&#x27;m not a thief</p>
<p>You were the only one in our dead friend&#x27;s house last night when the money was stolen &#x27;said Mr Paston  William tells us he was suddenly ill which prevented him from coming to take your place We will search your room</p>
<p>And when they went to Silas&#x27;s room Willia m fond the missing bag now empty under Silas&#x27;s bed</p>
<p>Silas my friend  cried William  confess your crime to us now Send the devil away from your soul</p>
<p>Silas turned to the man he had always trusted  William in the nine years since we&#x27;ve been friends have I ever told you a lie But God will prove the truth</p>
<p>As he looked at William he suddenly remembered something and reddened He said in a trembling voice  The knife wasn&#x27;t in my pocket last night</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean &#x27;replied William coldly</p>
<p>In the strange little world of the Light Street chapel they did not believe in the law or judges They thought only God knew the answers so they agreed to draw lots to decide what had happened They all went down on their knees to ask for God&#x27;s help in finding th truth Silas knelt with them sure that God would prove his honesty There was silence as the minister took one of the papers out of the covered box</p>
<p>The lots say that Silas Marner has stolen the money  he said  You will leave the chapel Silas Marner and you will not be accepted back until you confess your crime</p>
<p>Silas listened in horror At last he walked over to William Dane and said firmly  I lent you my knife you know that You stole the money while I was having a fit and you&#x27;ve blamed me for it But perhaps you&#x27;ll never be punished since there is no God who takes care of the good and punishes the bad only a God of lies</p>
<p>You hear my friends &#x27;said William smiling sadly   This is the voice of the devil speaking</p>
<p>Silas went home The next day he sat alone for the whole day too miserable to do anything On the second day the min  ister came to tell him that Sarah had decided she could not marry him Only a month later Sarah married William Dane and soon afterwards Silas Marner left the town</p>
<p>At Raveloe Silas shut himself away in his cottage He did not want to think about the disaster he had experienced He could not understand why God had refused to help him But now that his trust in God and his friends had been broken  he did not feel strong enough to build up that trust again in a new church and with new friends From now on he would live in a dark loveless hopeless world</p>
<p>All that was left to him was his weaving and he sat at his loom seven days a week working all the daylight hours In the town he had earned less and had given much of his money to the chapel for the old the poor and the sick But now he be gan to earn more than ever before and there was no reason for him to give away any of it He was often paid for his linen in gold He discovered that he liked holding the shining coins in his hand and looking at their bright faces</p>
<p>In his childhood Silas had been taught by his mother to make simple medicines from wild flowers and plants One day he saw the shoemaker&#x27;s wife Sally Oates sitting at her cottage door and he realized she had all the signs of the illness which had killed his mother He felt sorry for Sally and although he knew he could not prevent her dying he prepared some medicine for her which made her feel much better The vil lagers considered this a good example of Silas&#x27;s strange fright ening power but as it had worked for Sally they started visit-ing Silas to ask for help with their own illnesses But Silas was too honest to take their money and give them useless medicine He knew he had no special power and so he sent them away The villagers believed he was refusing to help them and they were angry with him They blamed him for accidents that hap pened to them and deaths in the village So poor Silas&#x27;s kind ness to Sally did not help him make friends in Raveloe</p>
<p>But little by little the piles of gold coins in his cottage grew higher The harder he worked the less he spent on himself He counted the coins into piles of ten and wanted to see them grow into a square and then into a larger square He was de lighted with every new coin but it made him want another His gold became a habit a delight a reason for living almost a reli gion He began to think the coins were his friends who made the cottage less lonely for him But it was only at night  when he had finished his work that he spent time with them He kept them in two bags under the floorboards near the loom Like a thirsty man who needs a drink he took them out every evening to look at them feel them and count them The coins shone in the firelight and Silas loved every one of them When he looked at his loom he thought fondly of the half earned gold in the work he was doing and he looked forward to the years ahead of him the countless days of weaving and the growing piles of gold</p>
<p>2 Godfrey and Dunstan Cass</p>
<p>The most important person in Raveloe was Squire Cass  a gentleman farmer who lived with his three sons in the handsome Red House opposite the church and owned a num-her of farms outside the village His wife had died many years before</p>
<p>One dark November evening fifteen years after Silas Marner had first arrived in Raveloe some of the villagers were drinking beer in the public house the Rainbow Old Mr Macey the church clerk was remembering the Squire&#x27;s wife</p>
<p>She was a wonderful lady  he said shaking his grey head sadly  Everything was always so pretty and clean at the Red House when she was alive When she died all those years ago the poor Squire well he didn&#x27;t know what to do And he&#x27;s still lonely believe me That&#x27;s why we often see him in here in the evenings And another thing if poor Mrs Cass were alive today I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d be very disappointed with her sons The Squire should make those boys do some work but in stead he lets them stay at home and gives them money to spend on horses or gambling or women</p>
<p>Come come Mr Macey &#x27;said the landlord  They&#x27;re rich young gentlemen after all You can&#x27;t expect them to work on the farms like us country people But you&#x27;re right about Dun stan Cass He&#x27;s a bad one he is Always borrowing money and never paying it back Always gambling always in trouble He&#x27;ll come to a bad end he will</p>
<p>But the other two are different &#x27;said the butcher a red-faced smiling man  Bob Cass is still only a boy And Mr God-frey the eldest well I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;ll be like his brother Dunstan Just look at him He&#x27;s got an open honest face And he&#x27;s going to inherit the Squire&#x27;s money and all the land And what&#x27;s more he&#x27;s going to marry Miss Nancy Lammeter When she moves into the Red House as Mrs Godfrey Cass she&#x27;ll make life more comfortable for all the Casses She&#x27;ll save the Squire money too the Lammeters have the best of every thing in their house but they&#x27;re very careful with their money</p>
<p>The farrier a small man with a sharp face always enjoyed disagreeing with the butcher  Mr Godfrey marry Miss Nancy  he laughed  That&#x27;s what you think Haven&#x27;t you noticed how Miss Nancy has changed towards Godfrey since last year You remember he was away from home for days and days Nobody knows what he was doing but Godfrey hasn&#x27;t been the same since then Miss Nancy isn&#x27;t stupid she won&#x27;t marry a man she can&#x27;t trust</p>
<p>The landlord always tried to prevent his customers from ar-guing  What you all say is very true But let&#x27;s hope that Mr Godfrey doesn&#x27;t lose his chance of marrying Miss Nancy</p>
<p>Meanwhile at the Red House Godfrey Cass was waiting for his brother in the sitting room with a very worried expression on his handsome face Soon the door opened and a heavy-look-ing young man entered It was Dunstan He had clearly been drinking</p>
<p>How I hate him &#x27;thought Godfrey</p>
<p>Well sir &#x27;said Dunstan unpleasantly  you sent for me and as you&#x27;re the oldest and you&#x27;ll be the Squire one day I have to obey you So what do you want</p>
<p>Just listen will you &#x27;replied Godfrey angrily  if you aren&#x27;t too drunk to understand You must pay me back the money I lent you last month You know I got it from Fowler of Church Farm He owed the money to the Squire and asked me to give it to him Now the Squire is angry with Fowler for not paying and I&#x27;ve got to give the money back</p>
<p>Dunstan came close to Godfrey and smiled in an evil way  Well my dear kind brother why don&#x27;t you find the money yourself That would be much less trouble for me</p>
<p>Godfrey controlled himself with difficulty  Don&#x27;t smile at me like that or I&#x27;ll hit you</p>
<p>Oh no you won&#x27;t answered Dunstan  Because if you do I&#x27;ll tell the Squire your secret I&#x27;ll tell him that his handsome eldest son fell in love with that poor girl Molly in the town and married her in a hurry The Squire&#x27;ll be angry because you married her in secret and he&#x27;ll disinherit you Then I&#x27;ll get the house and land when the old man dies But don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;m a good brother to you I won&#x27;t tell him and you&#x27;ll find the money to pay back I know you will</p>
<p>Where can I get the money from  cried Godfrey  I tell you I haven&#x27;t got any</p>
<p>You could borrow It &#x27;said Dunstan carelessly  Or wait-I&#x27;ve had a better idea You could sell your horse</p>
<p>Sell Wildfire You know how muchl love that horse</p>
<p>Well you could ride him to the hunt tomorrow I know two or three men who&#x27;d be interested in buying him and they&#x27;ll be at the hunt I&#x27;m sure It&#x27;d be easy</p>
<p>No I haven&#x27;t got time to go hunting tomorrow I-I&#x27;m going to Mrs Osgood&#x27;s birthday dance</p>
<p>Aha &#x27;said Dunstan laughing  And perhaps you&#x27;ll see sweet Miss Nancy there and you&#x27;ll dance with her and you&#x27;ll talk of love</p>
<p>Be quiet &#x27;shouted Godfrey his face turning red  Don&#x27;t speak of Miss Nancy like that or I&#x27;ll kill you</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get so angry brother  answered Dunstan calmly  You&#x27;ve got a very good chance with her In fact I advise you to be nice to her You and I know that Molly&#x27;s started drink ing Well if she drinks too much one day and dies then you could marry Nancy She wouldn&#x27;t mind being a second wife if she didn&#x27;t know there was a first And luckily you&#x27;ve got a kind brother who&#x27;ll keep your secret well</p>
<p>Godfrey&#x27;s face was white now and he was trembling  Look Dunstan I&#x27;ve nearly had enough of this You can push a man too far you know Perhaps I&#x27;ll go to the Squire now and confess everything to him He&#x27;ll discover the truth one day because Molly says she&#x27;ll come and tell him She wants every one to know we re married When the Squire knows the truth you won&#x27;t get any more money from me</p>
<p>Dunstan replied lightly  Do what you like brother</p>
<p>Godfrey hesitated He knew he had fallen into Dunstan&#x27;s trap when he made the mistake of marrying Molly It was Dunstan who had Introduced his brother to Molly hoping that Godfrey would fall in love and marry her Dunstan was clearly delighted that his evil plan had succeeded Godfrey was now in a difficult situation He no longer loved his young wife and could not stop thinking of Nancy Lammeter He felt sure that with Nancy as his wife he would not need to have secrets and could be open and honest with everybody But for the moment he had to give Dunstan whatever he wanted keep Molly happy and lie to his father and his friends If he told his father the truth the situation would become impossible The Squire would disinherit him and he would be just a poor working man for the rest of his life And far worse than that he would lose any hope of marrying Nancy No He could not accept that He would find the money for Dunstan and wait for the situa tion to get better Living with fear in his heart the fear of be ing discovered was better than living without Nancy&#x27;s love</p>
<p>He turned to Dunstan  It&#x27;s just like you to talk of selling Wildfire the best horse I&#x27;ve ever had</p>
<p>Let me sell him for you-you know I&#x27;m good at buying and selling I can ride him to the hunt for you tomorrow and bring you back the money But you must decide You lent me that money and you&#x27;ll have to pay it back to the Squire So it&#x27;s your problem not mine</p>
<p>Godfrey thought for a moment  All right  he said  But make sure you bring me back all the money Dunstan</p>
<p>The next morning as Dunstan was riding Wildfire out of Rav eloe he passed the old quarry All the stone had been taken out of it and it was no longer used now all that was left was a deep hole full of reddish water Opposite the quarry was Silas Marn er&#x27;s cottage Dunstan suddenly had an idea  Everybody in Raveloe talks of the weaver&#x27;s money he must have a lot hid den away in that cottage Why doesn&#x27;t Godfrey borrow some money from him and pay him back when he becomes the Squire  He wondered whether to go back to the Red House at once to tell Godfrey about this wonderful idea of his but he did not want to miss the hunt so he decided to continue on his way</p>
<p>At the hunt he met several friends and neighbours and be fore the hunt started he managed to sell Wildfire for a good price The money would be paid when he brought the horse to the neighbour&#x27;s house later that day Dunstan knew it would be safer to take the horse there immediately so that he could be sure of receiving the money But he was confident that he could take care of Wildfire during the hunt and so after a glass or two of whisky he joined the other riders in the fields This time however he was not as lucky as usual and horse and rid-er fell while jumping a gate Dunstan got up shaken but unhurt but poor Wildfire&#x27;s back was broken and in a few mo ments he died</p>
<p>Dunstan looked around and was glad to see that no other riders had noticed his accident He did not want people to think he was a bad rider He did not care much about Wildfire be cause he thought he now had a much better plan to offer God frey The worst thing was that he would have to walk home something he was not at all used to doing</p>
<p>He drank some more whisky from the bottle he kept in his pocket and started down the country road He kept thinking about Silas&#x27;s money There would certainly be enough for his own needs as well as Godfrey&#x27;s Dunstan thought it would be easy to frighten the weaver a little and then Silas would quick ly agree to lend his money</p>
<p>It was four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon and the whole country side was covered by a thick mist Dunstan did not see anyone on his way back to Raveloe He knew he was getting close to the old quarry although he could not see the road in front of him At last he saw light coming from the weaver&#x27;s cottage and he decided to knock at the door  Why not ask the old man for the money now he thought</p>
<p>But when he knocked loudly there was no reply And when he pushed the door it opened Dunstan found himself in front of a bright fire which showed every corner of the small living-room Silas Marner was not there Dunstan was tired and cold so he went quickly to sit by the warm fire As he sat down he noticed a small piece of meat cooking over the fire It was hanging from a large door key   So the old man&#x27;s cooking meat for his supper is he &#x27;thought Dunstan  But where is he Why is his door unlocked Perhaps he went out to fetch some wood for the fire and fell into the quarry Perhaps he&#x27;s dead &#x27;this was an interesting new idea  And if he&#x27;s dead who inherits his mon ey Who would know that anybody had come to take it away  And the most important question of all  Where is the money</p>
<p>Dunstan&#x27;s excitement made him forget that the weaver could still be alive He wanted Silas to be dead and he wanted Silas&#x27;s money He looked round the cottage again There was very little furniture just a bed the loom three chairs and a table Dunstan looked under the bed but the money was not there Then he noticed a plsce on the floor near the loom where the floorboards looked different By pulling up one of the boards he discovered Silas&#x27;s hiding place He took out the two heavy bags filled with gold put the boards back and hurried to the door</p>
<p>Outside the rain was falling heavily and he could not see anything at all Carrying the heavy bags he stepped forward into the darkness</p>
<p>3 Where is Silas&#x27;s gold</p>
<p>When Dunstan Cass left the cottage Silas Marner was only a hundred metres away He was walking home from the village where he had gone to buy what he needed for his next day&#x27;s work His legs were tired but he felt almost happy He was looking forward to supper-time when he would bring out his gold Tonight he had an extra reason to hurry home He was going to eat hot meat which was unusual for him And it would cost him nothing because someone had giv-en him a piece of meat as a present He had left it cooking over the fire The door key was needed to hold it safely in place but Silas was not at all worried about leaving his gold in the cot-tage with the door unlocked He could not imagine that a thief would find his way through the mist rain and darkness to the little cottage by the quarry</p>
<p>When he reached his cottage and opened the door he did not notice that anything was different He threw off his wet coat and pushed the meat closer to the fire As soon as he was warm again he began to think about his gold It seemed a long time to wait until after supper when he usually brought out the coins to look at So he decided to bring out his gold immediate ly while the meat was still cooking</p>
<p>But when he took up the floorboards near the loom and saw the empty hole he did not understand at once His heart beat violently as his trembling hands felt all round the hole There was nothing there He put his hands to his head and tried to think Had he put his gold in a different place and forgotten about it He searched every corner of his small cottage until he could not pretend to himself any more He had to accept the truth his gold had been stolen</p>
<p>He gave a wild desperate scream and stood still for a mo ment Then he turned towards his loom and almost fell into the seat where he always worked He touched the loom to make sure it too had not been stolen Now he was beginning to think more clearly  A thief has been here If I can find him he&#x27;ll have to give back my gold But I was only away for a short time and there&#x27;s no sign of anyone entering the cottage  He wondered whether it was really a thief who had taken his money or whether it was the same cruel God who had already destroyed his happiness once But Silas preferred to suspect a thief who would perhaps return the money He began to think it must be Jem Rodney a local poacher who had known about Silas&#x27;s money and who sometimes visited the cottage Silas felt stronger now that he thought he knew the thief  I must go and tell the Squire and the police  he said to himself  They&#x27;ll make Jem give me back the money &#x27;so he hurried out in the rain without a coat and ran towards the Rainbow</p>
<p>He thought he would find the most important people in Rav eloe at the public house but in fact most of them were at Mrs Osgood&#x27;s birthday dance There were however five villagers at the Rainbow enjoying an interesting conversation about ghosts while drinking their beer</p>
<p>I tell you people have seen ghosts &#x27;the butcher said  And I&#x27;ll tell you where too Behind the church</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right  agreed old Mr Macey  You young ones aren&#x27;t old enough to remember but people have seen ghosts near the church since I was a boy Oh yes it&#x27;s true</p>
<p>The farrier laughed scornfully  Ghosts People imagine they see things on a dark night You can&#x27;t make me believe in ghosts It&#x27;s a question of fact There are no ghosts</p>
<p>Now now  began the lanalord who always tried to keep the peace  in some ways you&#x27;re all wrong and in some ways you&#x27;re all right that&#x27;s my opinion There are ghosts and there aren&#x27;t well that&#x27;s what people say And</p>
<p>Just then Silas&#x27;s white face appeared suddenly in the door way He had run all the way from his cottage so he could not speak for a moment He stared silently at the men with his strange staring eyes looking exactly like a ghost For a few minutes nobody said anything while Silas tried to control his breathing Then the landlord spoke</p>
<p>What do you want Master Marner Come tell us</p>
<p>Robbed  cried Silas suddenly able to speak  I&#x27;ve been robbed I want the police and the Squire  He waved his arms wildly as he spoke</p>
<p>Hold him Jem &#x27;said the landlord to the poacher who was sitting near the door  I think he&#x27;s gone mad</p>
<p>But Jem moved quickly away  Not me  he replied  I don&#x27;t want anything to do with a ghost</p>
<p>Jem Rodney  cried Silas turning and staring at the man he suspected</p>
<p>Yes Master Marner  answered Jem trembling a little</p>
<p>If it was you who stole my money &#x27;said Silas going close to Jem  just give it back to me and I won&#x27;t tell the police Please just give it back</p>
<p>Stole your money  cried Jem angrily  I&#x27;ll throw this glass at you if you accuse me of stealing your money</p>
<p>Come now Master Matner &#x27;said the landlord firmly tak ing Silas by the arm  You must explain what you mean if you want us to believe you And sit down by the fire to dry your clothes You&#x27;re very wet</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right &#x27;said the farrier  No more staring like a madman That&#x27;s what I thought you were at first not a ghost of course</p>
<p>The weaver sat down in the centre of the little group of men and told his story It felt strange but pleasant to him to talk to his neighbours and tell them his problems The men re alized at once that Silas was telling the truth They had sus pected him of working for the devil but they knew now that the devil was no longer taking care of him</p>
<p>Well Master Marner &#x27;said the landlord in the end  you mustn&#x27;t accuse poor Jem He sometimes steals a chicken we all know that but he&#x27;s been sitting here drinking with us all evening So he&#x27;s not the thief</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right &#x27;said old Mr Macey  You can&#x27;t accuse someone who hasn&#x27;t done anything wrong Master Marner</p>
<p>These words brought the past back to Silas and he remem bered standing in front of his accusers in the Light Street chapel He went up to Jem</p>
<p>I was wrong  he said miserably  I&#x27;m sorry Jem I had no reason to accuse you But where can my gold be</p>
<p>Perhaps some stranger came to your cottage while you were out &#x27;said the farrier  But we must report the robbery to the police and the Squire immediately</p>
<p>Next morning when the whole village heard about the stolen gold they all discussed it excitedly A few people still did not trust Silas or believe his story Most people however were suspicious of the pedlar who had visited Raveloe the month be fore Perhaps he had returned to hide near the quarry and steal the money when Silas left his cottage Several villagers thought they remembered his evil-looking face and felt sure he was not honest</p>
<p>Silas himself remembered that the pedlar had come to his cottage door recently He hoped the pedlar was indeed the thief because the police could catch him and make him give back the money His home seemed very empty to him without his gold and he desperately wanted to get it back</p>
<p>4 Godfrey is in trouble</p>
<p>Godfrey was not very surprised to find that Dunstan had not come home after his day&#x27;s hunting Perhaps he was staying the night at a public house But when Dunstan did not return home the next day Godfrey began to worry about Wild-fire He did not trust his brother and wondered if Dunstan had gone away to spend the money on gambling So he decided to go to look for him On the road near Raveloe he met his neigh-bour John Bryce who had arranged to buy Wildfire from Dun stan</p>
<p>Well Godfrey &#x27;said Bryce  did your brother tell you about the horse</p>
<p>What do you mean John &#x27;replied Godfrey quickly  No he hasn&#x27;t been home yet What&#x27;s happened to my horse</p>
<p>Ah so he was yours was he Dunstan told me you&#x27;d giv-en him Wildfire I was going to buy him you know</p>
<p>What&#x27;s Dunstan done Is Wildfire hurt  asked Godfrey crossly</p>
<p>Worse than that  answered Bryce  I&#x27;m afraid your horse is dead  We&#x27;ve only just found him Your brother rode him to the hunt and the horse fell at a gate and broke his back So you haven&#x27;t seen Dunstan since yesterday</p>
<p>No and he&#x27;d better not come home now &#x27;replied Godfrey angrily  How stupid I was to trust him with my horse</p>
<p>But where can Dunstan be I suppose he wasn&#x27;t hurt be cause we didn&#x27;t find him near the horse</p>
<p>Him &#x27;said Godfrey bitterly  Oh he&#x27;ll be all right He&#x27;ll never be hurt he only ever hurts other people We&#x27;ll hear of him soon enough don&#x27;t worry</p>
<p>Bryce said goodbye and rode away Godfrey rode slowly back into Raveloe thinking about what he would very soon have to do There was no longer any escape He must confess the whole truth to his father For the rest of the day he planned what he would say He would explain that he had lent Fowler&#x27;s money to Dunstan because Dunstan knew his secret That would be the right moment to tell the Squire about his secret marriage to Molly  But he&#x27;ll be very angry &#x27;thought Godfrey  And when he&#x27;s angry with people he just wants to punish them He won&#x27;t listen or calm down But perhaps he&#x27;ll keep my se-cret he&#x27;s so proud of the family name And if he disinherited me everyone would talk about it</p>
<p>When he went to bed that night  Godfrey thought he had decided what to say But when he woke up in the morning he could not see any reason to confess to the marriage Why should he lose the chance of marrying Nancy  Why should he tell the whole truth now  when perhaps it was not necessary No it would be better to go on in the same way as before Per haps Dunstan would stay away for a while and then there would be no need to tell his father about Molly  But today I&#x27;ll tell the Squire about the money  he thought  He&#x27;ll have to know about that</p>
<p>Godfrey was already in the dining-room when his father ar-rived for breakfast The Squire sat down at the head of the table and ordered the servant to bring him some beer</p>
<p>Haven&#x27;t you had breakfast yet Godfrey  he asked</p>
<p>Yes I have sir &#x27;replied Godfrey  but I was waiting to speak to you</p>
<p>Well you young people have plenty of time  answered the Squire  We older ones have to do all the work</p>
<p>Godfrey looked straight at his father  Sir  he said bravely  I must tell you something very unfortunate has happened to Wildfire</p>
<p>What Has he broken a leg I thought you could ride bet-ter than that Well you can&#x27;t expect me to pay for a new horse I&#x27;m very short of money at the moment And I&#x27;m angry with Fowler he still hasn&#x27;t paid me what he owes me If he doesn&#x27;t pay today he&#x27;ll go to prison &#x27;the Squire&#x27;s face was red  and he banged angrily on the table as he spoke</p>
<p>It&#x27;s worse than breaking a leg  continued Godfrey miser-ably  Wildfire&#x27;s dead But I don&#x27;t want you to buy me anoth-er horse I just feel sorry I can&#x27;t pay you you see sir the truth is I&#x27;m very sorry Fowler did pay the money He gave it to me and I was stupid enough to let Dunstan have it And he was going to sell Wildfire and then I was going to repay you the money</p>
<p>The Squire&#x27;s face was purple now and for a moment he could not speak  You you let Dunstan have my money Why did you give it to him  And why did he want it Where&#x27;s Dunstan now He&#x27;ll answer my questions  or leave this house Go and fetch him at once</p>
<p>Dunstan hasn&#x27;t come home sir The horse was found dead and nobody knows where Dunstan is   Well why did you let him have my money  Answer me &#x27;said the Squire staring angrily at Godfrey</p>
<p>Well sir I don&#x27;t know &#x27;replied Godfrey hesitating He was not good at lying and was not prepared for his father&#x27;s questions</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t know &#x27;the Squire repeated scornfully  Well  I know why  I think you&#x27;ve done something wrong  and you&#x27;ve bribed Dunstan to keep it a secret That&#x27;s it isn&#x27;t it</p>
<p>The Squire had made a very clever guess and Godfrey&#x27;s heart banged in sudden alarm He was not ready to confess ev erything yet  Well sir  he said trying to speak carelessly  it was just a little business between Dunstan and me  You wouldn&#x27;t be interested in it you know</p>
<p>How old are you now Twenty six  asked the Squire an grily  Old enough to look after your money and mine too I&#x27;ve been much too generous to you boys  but I&#x27;m going to be harder on you all from now on  You&#x27;ve got a weak character Godfrey  like your poor mother  I think you need a wife who knows what she wants  because you can&#x27;t decide anything by yourself When you were thinking of marrying Nancy Lammeter I agreed  didn&#x27;t I Have you asked her or not She hasn&#x27;t refused to marry you  has she</p>
<p>No I haven&#x27;t asked her &#x27;said Godfrey feeling very hot ad uncomfortable  but I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll accept me</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be stupid  Godfrey &#x27;said the Sqiuire with a scornful laugh  Any woman would want to marry into our family Do you want to marry her</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no other woman I want to marry &#x27;said Godfrey avoiding his father&#x27;s eyes</p>
<p>Well then let me speak to her father for you since you aren&#x27;t brave enough to do it yourself  She&#x27;s a pretty girl  and intelligent</p>
<p>No sir please don&#x27;t say anything at the moment &#x27;said Godfrey quickly  I must ask her myself</p>
<p>Well ask her then When you marry her you&#x27;ll have to forget about horses and so on It&#x27;ll be good for you to do some serious work  You should get married soon</p>
<p>Please don&#x27;t try to hurry things sir  begged Godfrey</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll do what I like &#x27;said the Squire firmly  And if you don&#x27;t do what I want I&#x27;ll disinherit you and you can leave the house Now if you know where Dunstan&#x27;s hiding I expect you do tell him he needn&#x27;t come home  He&#x27;ll pay for his own food from now on</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know where he is sir Anyway it&#x27;s you who should tell him to leave home</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t argue with me Godfrey &#x27;said the Squire turning back to his breakfast  Just go and tell the servants to get my horse ready</p>
<p>Godfrey left the room  He was relieved that his father had not discovered the whole truth However  he was a little wor ried that the Squire would try to arrange his marriage with Nancy While he was married to Molly he could not marry Nancy although it was his dearest wish But as usual he was waiting and hoping for some unexpected change in his situation  which would save him from any unpleasantness</p>
<p>5 Silas&#x27;s neighbours</p>
<p>In the weeks following the robbery the police tried hard to find the pedlar because so many people suspected him of being the thief But there was no sign of him in any of the towns and villages round Raveloe</p>
<p>Nobody was surprised at Dunstan Cass&#x27;s absence Once be-fore he had stayed away for six weeks and then come back No-body imagined he could have anything to do with the robbery The villagers continued to discuss Silas and his lost gold but they had no more explanations to offer</p>
<p>Silas himself still had his loom and his work so he went on weaving But the only thing that had made his life worth living had gone and now he had nothing to look forward to A life time of empty evenings lay ahead of him  He did not enjoy thinking of the money he would earn because it reminded him of the money he had lost As he sat weaving he sometimes used to moan quietly to himself And in the evenings as he sat alone in front of the fire he used to put his head in his hands and moan again</p>
<p>But this disaster had one good result Little by little Silas&#x27;s neighbours realized it was wrong to be suspicious of him  He was just a poor simple harmless man who needed their help</p>
<p>They showed their new opinion of him in many different ways Some of the women who were baking cakes and preparing meat for Christmas brought him presents of food Some of the men who had nothing to give him stopped him in the village to ask about his health or visited him to discuss the robbery They often finished their conversation by saying cheerfully  Now you&#x27;re the same as the rest of us we&#x27;re poor too Cheer up Master Marner If you get ill and can&#x27;t work any more the Squire&#x27;ll give you food and your neigh bours will take care of you &#x27;this did not make Silas feel better but he realized it was meant kindly</p>
<p>Old Mr Macey the church clerk came to the cottage one day to explain how his opinion of the weaver had changed</p>
<p>You see Master Marner  he said in his high old voice  I used to think you worked for the devil you&#x27;ve always looked strange you know But now I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re not evil just a lit-tle bit crazy That&#x27;s what I tell the neighbours</p>
<p>He stopped to give Silas time to reply but the weaver did not speak He was sitting with his head in his hands as usual He knew that the old man was trying to be kind but he was too miserable to show any interest</p>
<p>Come Master Marner  what&#x27;s your answer to that  asked Mr Macey  a little impatiently</p>
<p>Oh &#x27;said Silas slowly lifting his head  thank you  Thank you for your kindness</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all right &#x27;replied the old man pleased   Now  you shouldn&#x27;t sit here moaning you know  Here&#x27;s my advice to you Ask Tookey in the village to make you a Sunday suit I don&#x27;t expect you&#x27;ve got one and then you can come to church with your neighbours It&#x27;ll make you feel better You&#x27;re not an old man yet although you look like one  How old were you when you came here first  Twenty-five</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t remember  answered Silas shaking his head</p>
<p>That evening Mr Macey told a number of villagers at the Rainbow  Poor Master doesn&#x27;t know how old he is And I don&#x27;t suppose he knows what day of the week it is He really is a bit crazy</p>
<p>Another villager Dolly Winthrop was also worried about Silas&#x27;s absence from church She was a large fresh-faced wom an with a sweet patient smile who was always busy from early morning until late at night and who went to church herself ev ery Sunday She believed in helping her neighbours and if someone in Raveloe was ill or dying Dolly was often asked to take care of the patient This good sensible woman decided that Silas needed her help So one Sunday afternoon she took her son Aaron a pretty little boy of seven  to visit the weaver As they came closer to the cottage they heard the sound of the loom</p>
<p>Oh dear Working on a Sunday That&#x27;s bad &#x27;said Mrs Winthrop sadly She had to knock loudy on the door before Silas heard He said nothing but opened the door to let them in and Dolly sat down in an armchair</p>
<p>I was baking yesterday Master Marner &#x27;she said   and I&#x27;ve brought you some of my cakes Here they are</p>
<p>Thank you &#x27;replied Silas taking the little bag of cakes Dolly was holding out to him Aaron was hiding behind his mother&#x27;s chair in childish fear of the weaver</p>
<p>You didn&#x27;t hear the church bells this morning perhaps Master Marner &#x27;dolly asked gently  This cottage is a long way from the village</p>
<p>Yes I heard them  answered Silas For him Sunday bells did not mean anything There had been no bells at the Light Street chapel</p>
<p>Oh &#x27;said Dolly  But but do you have to work on a Sun day  You could make Sunday different from the other days you know  by washing yourself and cooking a little piece of meat and going to church And Master Marner Christmas Day will be here soon If you put on your best clothes and go to church and see the flowers and hear the singing you&#x27;ll feel much better You&#x27;ll know there is Someone you can trust</p>
<p>Dolly did not usually talk so much but the matter seemed extremely important to her</p>
<p>No no &#x27;silas replied  I don&#x27;t know anything about church I&#x27;ve never been to church</p>
<p>Never been &#x27;repeated Dolly  Were there no churches in the town you were born in</p>
<p>Oh yes &#x27;said Silas  there were a lot of churches It was a big town you see But I only ever went to chapel</p>
<p>Dolly did not understand this word but was afraid of asking any more questions in case  chapel&#x27;meant something evil After considering carefully for a moment she said  Well Master Marner it&#x27;s never too late to start going to church It&#x27;s very pleasant listening to the singing and the good words If we go to church rhen when trouble comes Someone will take care of us And if we do our best then I believe Someone will help us when we need help</p>
<p>Dolly&#x27;s explanation of her simple religion did not seem at all clear to Silas but he did understand that she was asking him to go to church He did not want to agree to that Just then young Aaron came out from behind his mother&#x27;s chair and Silas of-fered him one of Dolly&#x27;s cakes</p>
<p>Oh Aaron &#x27;said his mother  You&#x27;re always eating No don&#x27;t give him any more Master Marner But he can sing a song for you I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it It&#x27;s a beautiful Christmas carol Come Aaron let&#x27;s hear it</p>
<p>Little Aaron stood up straight and sang his carol in a clear sweet voice Dolly listened with delight hoping that the carol would help to persuade Silas to come to church</p>
<p>You see Master Marner &#x27;she said when Aaron had fin ished  that&#x27;s Christmas music The Christmas Day service is wonderful with all the voices and the music I hope you&#x27;ll be there with us And remember if you feel ill I&#x27;ll be happy to come and cook or clean for you But I beg you please stop weaving on Sundays It&#x27;s bad for soul and body I&#x27;m sure We must go now Goodbye Master Marner</p>
<p>Thank you and goodbye &#x27;said Silas as he opened the door for them He could not help feeling relieved when she had gone Now he could weave and moan as much as he liked</p>
<p>Mr Macey and Dolly had tried hard to persuade Silas to go to church But in the end he spent Christmas Day alone in his cot tage looking out at the cold grey sky In the evening snow be gan to fall and he felt more distant and separate from his neighbours than ever He sat in his robbed home moaning mis erably to himself not noticing that his fire was no longer burn ing and that he was getting cold</p>
<p>But in Raveloe the church bells were ringing and the church was fuller than all through the rest of the year It was a special day for everybody and after the service they all hurried home in the biting cold to eat and drink with their families</p>
<p>At the Red House nobody spoke of Dunstan&#x27;s absence The village doctor Dr Kimble and his wife were guests there for Christmas lunch and the day passed happily</p>
<p>The servants however were already preparing for the New Year&#x27;s Eve dance which Squire Cass gave every year It was the best party of the year and guests used to come from miles around Godfrey was looking forward to this year&#x27;s party more than usual But he was still worried</p>
<p>What if Dunstan returns  he thought  He&#x27;ll tell the Squire about my secret marriage And Molly&#x27;s asking for more money I&#x27;ll have to sell something for cash But on New Year&#x27;s Eve I can forget everything for an evening and sit with Nancy and look into her eyes and dance with her</p>
<p>6 The New Year&#x27;s Eve dance</p>
<p>On December 3lst it was snowing and very cold All day there were ladies and gentlemen arriving at the Red House</p>
<p>Godfrey Cass was waiting at the door for the only guest he cared about Nancy Lammeter Finally she arrived sitting be hind her father on his horse looking more beautiful than ever Her lovely face blushed as she saw Godfrey come forward to lift her down from the horse  Why is he waiting for me &#x27;she thought  I thought I made it clear to him that I&#x27;ll never mar ry him People say he leads a bad life and I can&#x27;t marry a man like that</p>
<p>But the Squire appeared just then  to welcome his guests and in the excitement nobody noticed Nancy&#x27;s pink face as Godfrey&#x27;s strong arms lifted her down She hurried into the house with the other ladies to change her clothes</p>
<p>The house was full of servants running here and there Mrs Kimble who always helped the Squire arrange these parties was giving orders in a loud voice Cooks were preparing food in the kitchens and there was already a wonderful smell of baking in the air</p>
<p>Upstairs the ladies were excitedly putting on their best dresses while talking to each other all the time Nancy met her aunt Mrs Osgood who introduced her to some visitors of hers The Misses Gunn were two young ladies who were not beauti ful but dressed very fashionably</p>
<p>Just then Nancy&#x27;s older sister Priscilla arrived She was a large cheerful girl with a round face and a nose pink with cold As they were changing their clothes Priscilla said to Mrs Osgood  Look at our dresses aunt Of course Nancy looks beautiful in hers but this colour makes me look yellow  Nan cy says we must wear the same dresses because we&#x27;re sisters although I&#x27;m five years older I&#x27;m ugly I know I am But I don&#x27;t mind &#x27;she turned to Mrs Osgood&#x27;s two visitors  In my opinion the pretty girls are useful I&#x27;m sure you agree to catch the men I don&#x27;t think men are worth worrying about Any woman with a good father and a good home had better stay single That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do anyway We ugly girls don&#x27;t need husbands</p>
<p>Mrs Osgood stood up and said quickly  My visitors and I should go downstairs now Priscilla and Nancy we&#x27;ll see you later  And the three ladies hurried out</p>
<p>Oh really Priscilla  cried Nancy when they were alone  You never think before you speak  I&#x27;m sure the Misses Gunn thought you were very impolite You almost told them they were ugly</p>
<p>Did I  asked Priscilla in surprise  Well that&#x27;s the way I am I always tell the truth But I&#x27;m the ugly one just look at me</p>
<p>Priscilla you know I asked you to choose the dresses  replied Nancy worriedly  I don&#x27;t mind what colour I wear</p>
<p>You look lovely in this colour dear child You know you always have whatever you want in the end although you never give orders or shout about it I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing you married It&#x27;ll be fun watching you make your husband do exactly what you want</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t say that  answered Nancy  blushing   You know I&#x27;m never going to get married</p>
<p>Priscilla laughed  I&#x27;m the one who&#x27;ll stay single And if you don&#x27;t like Godfrey Cass well there are plenty of other young men Come let&#x27;s go downstairs now</p>
<p>Although Priscilla was right in saying she was not good-looking she was very popular among her neighbours because she was so cheerful and sensible And Nancy was not only con sidered to be the most beautiful girl in and around Raveloe but also one of the most intelligent</p>
<p>Seats at the dining table had been kept for the Lammeter sisters Priscilla was taken to sit between her father and the Squire Nancy felt herself blushing again as Godfrey Cass came to lead her to a seat between himself and the vicar Mr Crack enthorp She knew that if she married Godfrey she would one day be the most important woman in Raveloe the Squire&#x27;s wife But she repeated firmly to herself that she could not mar ry a man of bad character</p>
<p>As she sat down the vicar who was always polite to ladies said with a smile  Ah Miss Nancy you&#x27;re looking lovely this evening Isn&#x27;t she Go dfrey</p>
<p>Godfrey made no reply and avoided looking at Nancy  There was too much he wanted to say to her But the Squire  who al ways enjoyed his parties and was feeling extremely cheerful was rather impatient with his son He thought he had better speak if Godfrey was too shy to do it himself</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right &#x27;the Squire said loudly  When I look at Miss Nancy here I think she&#x27;s more beautiful than any girl I&#x27;ve ev-er seen</p>
<p>While they were eating and drinking people around the table were listening with interest to the Squire&#x27;s words   Per haps Godfrey will marry Nancy after all &#x27;the vicar&#x27;s wife whispered to Mrs Osgood Mr Lammeter&#x27;s back was very straight as he looked across the table at his daughter He was a serious careful gentleman who considered the Lammeters a better family than the Casses He had already decided that Godfrey must change his way of life before Nancy could possi-bly marry him</p>
<p>Just then Dr Kimble called across the table  Miss Nancy will you save a dance for me</p>
<p>Come come Kimble &#x27;said the Squire  let the young ones enjoy themselves My son Godfrey&#x27;ll be angry if you take Miss Nancy away I expect he&#x27;s asked her for the first dance already Haven&#x27;t you Godfrey</p>
<p>Godfrey was feeling very uncomfortable by now Turning to Nancy he said as lightly as possible  I haven&#x27;t asked her yet but I hope she&#x27;ll agree if nobody&#x27;s asked her</p>
<p>No I haven&#x27;t accapted anyone else &#x27;replied Nancy quietly with a blush</p>
<p>So will you please have the first dance with me  asked Godfrey beginning to feel better She had not refused him</p>
<p>I will  answered Nancy coldly She was still sure she would not marry him but she wanted to remain polite</p>
<p>Ah well you&#x27;re a lucky man Godfrey &#x27;said Dr Kimble with a laugh  I think I can hear the music starting now</p>
<p>The guests got up from the table in pairs and small groups to move into the large hall where the dancing was about to start The small village band was already playing as the Squire led the vicar&#x27;s wife to the end of the hall to start the dance They were followed by Godfrey and Nancy and the other ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>As the dance went on Godfrey felt happier and happier Holding Nancy in his arms he forgot all his problems Sudden ly the Squire&#x27;s heavy foot stood on part of Nancy&#x27;s dress and some of the material was pulled away at the waist Nancy asked Godfrey to take her to a quieter place where she could repair the damage He took her to a small room near the hall hoping they would have a few private moments together  But Nancy sat down on the chair furthest away from him  and said coldly  Thank you sir You needn&#x27;t stay  I&#x27;m very sorry about taking you away from the dance</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not very kind of you &#x27;said Godfrey moving close to her  to be sorry you&#x27;ve danced with me</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;replied Nancy blushing prettily  Gentlemen have so many things to enjoy I&#x27;m sure one dance can&#x27;t matter very much</p>
<p>You know that isn&#x27;t true You know one dance with you means more to me than anything else in the world</p>
<p>Nancy was a little surprised Godfrey had not said anything like this to her for a long time She replied firmly  I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t believe you Mr Godrey</p>
<p>Nancy if I changed my life would you think better of me Would you like me then  Godfrey knew these were danger ous words but the sudden chance of speaking to her alone made him say more than he had planned</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be glad to see a good change in anybody sir</p>
<p>You&#x27;re very hard Nancy &#x27;said Godfrey bitterly  You could help me to be better I&#x27;m very miserable but you don&#x27;t feel anything</p>
<p>I think people who behave badly don&#x27;t feel anything &#x27;said Nancy sharply forgetting to be cool and distant</p>
<p>Godfrey was delighted He wanted to make her argue with him to show him that she cared about him But just then Priscilla hurried in saying  Dear child let me look at your dress I saw the Squire step on it during the dance</p>
<p>I suppose I&#x27;d better go now  Godfrey said disappointedly to Priscilla</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter at all to me whether you go or stay &#x27;said Priscilla impatiently looking closely at the waist of Nancy&#x27;s dress</p>
<p>Do you want me to go  Godfrey asked Nancy</p>
<p>Do whatever you like &#x27;replied Nancy  trying to sound cold again</p>
<p>Well I want to stay  answered Godfrey and sat down Tonight he wanted to enjoy being with Nancy for as long as possible without thinking about what would happen tomorrow</p>
<p>7 Silas finds his gold</p>
<p>But while Godfrey Cass was managing to forget his prob-lems by the lovely Nancy&#x27;s side his wife was walking with slow uncertain steps along the snow coverea road to Ray eloe She was carrying her sleeping child in her arms</p>
<p>For some time now she had planned to come to Raveloe on New Year&#x27;s Eve She knew that her husband would be at the centre of a happy smiling group of friends and she had chosen this moment to appear in front of all his family and guests at the Red House dance  I don&#x27;t care if Godfrey is ashamed of mes &#x27;she thought bitterly  I want people to know we&#x27;re mar ried &#x27;sometimes she hated her husband  because he was still handsome and had money while she was no longer pretty and very poor She blamed him for her miserable life but in her heart she knew she should blame her drinking It had become a habit wiht her to spend most of the money Godfrey gave her on gin She had a bottle in her pocket now which she had lifted to her lips several times during her journey</p>
<p>It was already seven o&#x27;clock in the evening and there was a freezing wind Molly did not know she was very near Raveloe Her legs were tired and the gin was beginning to make her feel sleepy She thought she would rest for a while and still hold ing her child she lay down on the snow She did not notice that the ground was cold  In a few moments the child woke up crying  Mummy  But the mother did not seem to hear Suddenly as the child fell gently out of its mother&#x27;s arms on to the soft snow it noticed a bright dancing light on the white ground Interested the child stood up to see where the brightness came from and followed the light to an open door the door of Silas Marner&#x27;s cottage The little one toddled right in through the door and sat down by the bright fire After a few minutes the child felt pleasantly warm  and fell asleep</p>
<p>But where was Silas while this was happening In the evenings he sometimes used to open his door and look out He had some idea that his money would come back or that some-one would come with information about the thief Tonight was New Year&#x27;s Eve and the villagers had told him to stay awake until midnight because it would bring him good luck if he saw the beginning of the new year So tonight he was more restless than usual He opened his door several times during the evening and stared out but he saw and heard nothing in the silent freezing night The last time as he was standing at the door he had one of his fits and stood there completely uncon-scions holding the door open  When he became conscious again he closed the door and turned back to the fire But when his shortsighted eyes looked at the floor in front of the fire he seemed to see gold there Gold his own gold taken and then brought back to him in the same strange way His heart beat excitedly and for a few moments he was unable to move At last he reached out his hand to touch the gold but instead of hard metal coins his fin gers felt soft warm curls</p>
<p>With great surprise Silas fell on his knees to look at this wonderful thing It was a sleeping child Was he dreaming Could it be his little sister who had died when he was a child himself If it wasn&#x27;t a dream how had the child entered the cottage But thinking of his sister made him remember the past and his life at the Light Street chapel He wondered if this child was some kind of message from his past sent perhaps by the God he had once trusted</p>
<p>Just then the child woke up and began to cry Silas held it in his arms and spoke softly to quieten it He remembered that he had made some porridge earlier and gave a little to the child to eat She stopped crying and lifted her blue eyes with a smile to Silas&#x27;s face as she ate But then she pulled at her wet shoes trying to take them off and Silas suddenly realized she had come to the cottage through the snow So he picked her up and went to the door As he opened it and went out into the dark the child cried Mummy  and reached forward almost jump-ing out of his arms A few steps away Silas found a young woman&#x27;s body half-covered with snow</p>
<p>At the Red House everybody was enjoying the party Some people were still eating while others were dancing or playing cards Godfrey was looking forward to his next dance with Nancy He was watching her dreamily across the room when suddenly he saw something that made his lips go white and his whole body tremble  It was his own child carried in Silas Marner&#x27;s arms The weaver had come straight into the hall where the dancing was going on</p>
<p>Several people turned to look at the strange figure in the doorway The Squire could not understand why Sllas had come in uninvited  He stood up and asked angrily  Marner  what are you doing here</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve come for the doctor &#x27;replied Silas hurriedly   There&#x27;s a woman dead I think near my cottage</p>
<p>Godfrey had one great fear at that moment that the woman was not dead If she were his wife and she were dead he would be free to marry Nancy</p>
<p>While the Squire was calling for Dr Kimble the ladies came closer to look at the pretty child</p>
<p>Whose child is it  one of them asked</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know &#x27;replied Godfrey wildly  Some poor woman&#x27;s she&#x27;s been found in the snow I think</p>
<p>You&#x27;d better leave the poor child here with us then Master Marner  offered Mrs Kimble kindly</p>
<p>No I can&#x27;t let it go &#x27;said Silas unexpectedly  It&#x27;s come to me I don&#x27;t know where from I want to keep it   Well &#x27;said Mrs Kimble surprised  A single man like you Take care of a child Well  But the little one was holding on to Silas and smiling up at him confidently</p>
<p>Dr Kimble hurried into the hall  Where is this poor woman Near the old quarry Someone had better fetch Dolly Winthrop I&#x27;ll need her to help me</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go  cried Godfrey He wanted to get away before any one noticed his white face and shaking hands  and he needed time to think  He ran out into the night</p>
<p>When he and Dolly arrived at the quarry the doctor had moved the woman into Silas&#x27;s cottage and Godfrey had to wait outside He walked up and down in the snow for what seemed like hours  He knew he should tell the truth about the woman and the child but he could not make himself do what he knew was right  Is she dead &#x27;the voice inside his head asked  If she is I can marry Nancy And then I&#x27;ll be good and have no more secrets And I&#x27;ll make sure the child is taken care of of course</p>
<p>When Dr Kimble came out of the cottage Godfrey tried to speak calmly  I thought I&#x27;d wait to see  he began</p>
<p>Oh there was no need for you to come Why didn&#x27;t you send one of the men to fetch Dolly The woman&#x27;s dead  I&#x27;m afraid She&#x27;s very thin and looks very poor But she&#x27;s got a wedding ring on She&#x27;ll be buried tomorrow</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll just have a look at her &#x27;said Godfrey quickly   I think I saw a woman on the road yesterday with a child Perhaps it was her  And he ran into the cottage</p>
<p>There on the bed was his unloved wife He only looked at her for a moment  but for the rest of his life he never forgot her sad tired face</p>
<p>The weaver had come back with the doctor and was sitting by the fire with the child on his knees The little one was awake but her wide open blue eyes looked up into Godfrey&#x27;s face without recognizing him at all The father was glad of this but also a little sad especially when he saw the small hand pull lovingly at the weaver&#x27;s grey hair</p>
<p>So who&#x27;s going to take care of the child  Godfrey asked pretending not to show much interest</p>
<p>I am &#x27;replied Silas firmly  The mother&#x27;s dead and I sup-pose the child hasn&#x27;t got a father  She&#x27;s alone in the world and so am I My money&#x27;s gone I don&#x27;t know where and she&#x27;s come I don&#x27;t know where from I don&#x27;t understand it at all but I&#x27;m going to keep her</p>
<p>Poor little thing &#x27;said Godfrey  Let me give you some-thing for her clothes  He put his hand in his pocket and gave Silas some coins</p>
<p>As he walked back to the Red House he felt very relieved Nobody would recognize his dead wife and soon his secret would be buried with her Now he could talk of love to Nancy He could promise to be a good husband to her Only Dunstan knew about the secret marriage and perhaps Dunstan would never come home  What a good thing I didn&#x27;t confess every thing to the Squire  he thought  Now I can make Nancy and myself happy And the child Well it won&#x27;t matter to her whether I&#x27;m her father or not</p>
<p>That week the dead woman was buried in Raveloe and the child stayed at the weaver&#x27;s cottage The villagers were very surprised that Silas had decided to keep her but they liked him for wanting to help an orphan The women especially were very ready to give him useful advice on taking care of children</p>
<p>Dolly Winthrop came every day to help Silas  It&#x27;s no trou ble &#x27;she said  I get up early so I&#x27;ve got plenty of time And I can bring you some of Aaron&#x27;s old baby clothes so you won&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money on the child I can wash her and give her food and</p>
<p>Ye es &#x27;said silas hesitating He was looking a little jeal ously at the baby in Dolly&#x27;s arms  That&#x27;s very kind of you But but I want to do everything for her myself I want her to be fond of me She&#x27;s my child</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry &#x27;said Dolly gently giving him the child  Look she loves you the best See she&#x27;s smiling at you And so Silas learnt how to take care of the little girl He called her Eppie which had been his little sister&#x27;s name His life was quite different now When he was working and living only for his gold he had not been interested in the world outside his cottage or the people he sometimes met But now that he had another reason for living he had to look outward He spent hours in the fields with Eppie happily rediscovering the plants he used to know so well Together they visited his neighbours who were always delighted to see him and his adopted child His days and evenings were full taking care of a trusting lov-ing child</p>
<p>Godfrey Cass watched the little girl growing up with great interest During Eppie&#x27;s childhood he often gave money to Silas to spend on her but was careful that nobody should suspect him of being her father His life was also changing There was a new firmness about him which everyone noticed He was looking forward to marrying Nancy very soon  Nancy and I will have children  he thought happily  But I won&#x27;t forget that other child</p>
<p>8 Eppie has grown up</p>
<p>It was a bright autumn Sunday sixteen years after Silas had found Eppie in his cottage The Raveloe church bells were ringing and people were coming out of church after the morning service First came the new squire Godfrey Cass looking a little heavier now but with a straight back and a firm step On his arm was his wife Nancy still a pretty woman Just behind them came Mr Lammeter and Priscilla They all went into the Red House</p>
<p>You and Priscilla will stay for tea won&#x27;t you Nancy asked her father</p>
<p>My dear you must ask Priscilla &#x27;replied Mr Lammeter with a smile  She manages me and the farm as well</p>
<p>Well it&#x27;s better for your health if I manage everything fa ther &#x27;said Priscilla  Then there&#x27;s nothing for you to worry about No Nancy dear we must go home now  But you and I can have a walk round the garden while the servants are get ting the horses ready</p>
<p>When the sisters were alone in the garden Priscilla said  My dear I&#x27;m very glad you&#x27;re going to have a dairy Making your own butter will give you something to think about all the time You&#x27;ll never be sad when you&#x27;ve got a dairy  And she put her arm through her sister&#x27;s</p>
<p>Dear Priscilla &#x27;said Nancy gratefully  I&#x27;m only ever sad when Godfrey is I could be happy if he could accept our life as it is But it&#x27;s more difficult for a man</p>
<p>Men  cried Priscilla impatiently  They&#x27;re always wanting something new Never happy with what they&#x27;ve got I&#x27;m glad I was too ugly to get married I&#x27;m much happier with fa ther</p>
<p>Oh Priscilla &#x27;said Nancy  Don&#x27;t be angry with Godfrey he&#x27;s a very good husband  But of course he&#x27;s disappointed that we haven&#x27;t had children he wanted them so much</p>
<p>Well father is waiting for me I&#x27;d better go now Goodbye my dear  And the sisters kissed goodbye When Priscilla and her father had left Godfrey said  Nancy I think I&#x27;ll just go and look at some of the fields we&#x27;re draining near the old quarry</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll be back by tea-time dear</p>
<p>Oh yes I&#x27;ll be back in an hour</p>
<p>This was a habit of Godfrey&#x27;s on Sunday afternoons He en joyed walking round the fields that belonged to him now So Nancy often had a quiet hour at about this time which she spent reading or sometimes just thinking.</p>
<p>She remembered all the little things that had happened to her especially during her marriage in the last fifteen years  The great sadness of her married life had been the death of her only baby Like most women she had looked forward to be coming a mother very much But when the baby died soon af ter it was born she made herself accept the fact  She did not allow herself to think about it or to wish for anything different Godfrey however had been terribly disappointed es pecially when it seemed likely that Nancy could have no more children</p>
<p>Nancy&#x27;s religion was extremely important to her She firmly believed that people should accept whatever happened to them in life because it was God who decided everything But she un-derstood how difficult it was for Godfrey to accept that their marriage would be childless  Was I right &#x27;she wondered for the hundredth time  to refuse him when he said we should adopt a child I believe that if God hasn&#x27;t given us a child it&#x27;s because God doesn&#x27;t want us to have one I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m right But poor Godfrey It&#x27;s worse for him than for me I&#x27;ve got him  and the house and now the dairy to think about  But although he&#x27;s always good to me I know he&#x27;s unhappy he wants children so much</p>
<p>From the first moment Godfrey had spoken of adopting a child he had mentioned Eppie&#x27;s name She had always been the child he wanted to adopt He had no idea that Silas would rather die than lose Eppie and he imagined that the weaver would be glad if the child were adopted by the Cass family  After all the girl will have a much better life with us  he told himself  I can&#x27;t be really happy if we don&#x27;t have a child And I can never tell Nancy the truth about Eppie I&#x27;m afraid she&#x27;ll hate me for it</p>
<p>While Nancy was sitting quietly in the Red House thinking about her husband Silas and Eppie were sitting outside their cottage near the quarry They had been to church too which they did every week like the Casses and most of the villagers Silas had started taking Eppie to church when she was very young because Dolly Winthrop had persuaded him that every child should have some religious training Because of Eppie Silas was completely accepted in Raveloe now Nobody thought he was strange any more in fact he was almost a popular fig-ure in the village</p>
<p>He was older now and could not work as hard as he used to Recently as he had more time to think he had begun to re-member the past and his old friends at the Light Street chapel He realized how his once lonely life had changed since Eppie had come to him Now he had friends and trusted people and was happy  And he began to see that the God in the Raveloe church was the same God he had been so angry with the last time he had been to the chapel It seemed to him that there had been some mistake in his past which had thrown a dark shadow over his early life Perhaps now he would never know whether Mr Paston the chapel minister still thought he was guilty of stealing And he would never dis cover why the drawing of the lots had seemed to prove his guilt  But there must be a Good of goodness in this world  he thought  because He sent Eppie to me I must just trust and believe that He is right.&#x27;</p>
<p>He had told Eppie how her mother had died in the snow and he had given her the dead woman&#x27;s wedding ring Eppie was not at all interested in who her real father was as she thought she had the best father in the world already At the moment she was sitting close to Silas outside their door in the sunshine Neither of them had spoken for a while</p>
<p>Father &#x27;she said gently  if I get married do you think I should wear my mother&#x27;s ring</p>
<p>Oh Eppie &#x27;said Silas surprised  Are you thinking of get ting married then</p>
<p>Well Aaron was talking to me about it &#x27;replied Eppie blushing  You know he&#x27;s nearly twenty-four now and is earning good money  and he&#x27;d like to marry soon</p>
<p>And who would he like to marry  asked Silas with rather a sad smile</p>
<p>Why me of course daddy &#x27;said Eppie laughing and kiss ing her father  He won&#x27;t want to marry anyone else</p>
<p>And you&#x27;d like to marry him would you  asked Silas</p>
<p>Yes one day I don&#x27;t know when Aaron says everyone&#x27;s married some time But I told him that&#x27;s not true because you haven&#x27;t ever been married have you daddy</p>
<p>No child &#x27;said Silas  I was a lonely man before you were sent to me</p>
<p>But you&#x27;ll never be lonely again father &#x27;said Eppie loving ly  That&#x27;s what Aaron said He doesn&#x27;t want to take me away from you He wants us all to live together and he&#x27;ll do all the work and you needn&#x27;t work at all father He&#x27;ll be like a son to you</p>
<p>Well my child you&#x27;re young to be married &#x27;said Silas  But he&#x27;s a good young man We&#x27;ll ask his mother what we should do She always gives us good advice You see Eppie I&#x27;m getting older and I&#x27;d like to think of you with a strong young husband to take care of you for the rest of your life Yes we&#x27;ll ask Dolly Winthrop for her opinion</p>
<p>9 Godfrey confesses at last</p>
<p>At the Red House Nancy was waiting patiently for God frey to come home to tea Suddenly one of the servants ran into the sitting-room crying excitedly  Madam there are lots of people in the street They&#x27;re all running the same way towards the quarry Perhaps there&#x27;s been an accident</p>
<p>Jane don&#x27;t get so excited &#x27;replied Nancy calmly  I ex-pect it&#x27;s nothing serious Go and get the tea ready Mr Godfrey will be back soon  But secretly she was saying to herself  I hope nothing&#x27;s happened to Godfrey</p>
<p>So when he came into the room a few minutes later she was very relieved  My dear I&#x27;m so thankful you&#x27;ve come &#x27;she said going towards him  I was beginning to think</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly when she saw Godfrey&#x27;s shaking hands and white face She put her hand on his arm but he did not seem to notice and threw himself into a chair</p>
<p>Sit down Nancy  he said with difficulty  I came back as soon as I could to prevent anyone telling you except me  It&#x27;s terrible news for me  but I&#x27;m more worried about how you will feel about it</p>
<p>It isn&#x27;t father or Priscilla &#x27;said Nancy trying to control her trembling lips</p>
<p>No it&#x27;s nobody living &#x27;said Godfrey  It&#x27;s Dunstan my brother who left home sixteen years ago and never came back We&#x27;ve found him found his body all that&#x27;s left of it in the old quarry</p>
<p>Nancy felt calmer now That was not terrible news</p>
<p>You know the men have been draining our fields near the quarry Well as a result  the quarry has suddenly gone dry and we&#x27;ve found him lying at the bottom  We know it&#x27;s him be cause he&#x27;s wearing his watch and his rings</p>
<p>Godfrey paused It was not easy to say what came next</p>
<p>Do you think he drowned himself  asked Nancy wonder ing why her husband was so shaken by the death of a brother he had never loved</p>
<p>No he fell in &#x27;replied Godfrey in a low voice  Dunstan was the man who robbed Silas Marner The bags of gold were found with his body</p>
<p>Oh Godfrey I am sorry &#x27;said Nancy She understood how ashamed her husband must be The Casses were so proud of their family name</p>
<p>I had to tell you I couldn&#x27;t keep it from you  Godfrey continued and then stopped looking at the ground for two long minutes Nancy knew that he had something more to say Finally Godfrey lifted his eyes to her face and said  Every body&#x27;s secrets are discovered sooner or later Nancy I&#x27;ve lived with a secret ever since I married you but I&#x27;m going to confess it now I don&#x27;t want you to discover it from someone else or hear about it when I&#x27;m dead I was weak and hesitating when I was younger I&#x27;m going to be firm with myself now</p>
<p>Nancy could not speak She stared at her husband in horror What secret could he possibly have from her</p>
<p>Nancy &#x27;said Godfrey slowly  when I married you I hid something from you I was wrong not to tell you That woman Silas Marner found dead in the snow Eppie&#x27;s moth er that poor woman was my wife Eppie is my child</p>
<p>He paused looking worriedly at Nancy But she sat quite still although her face looked rather white</p>
<p>Perhaps you won&#x27;t be able to love me any more  he said his voice trembling a little</p>
<p>She was silent</p>
<p>I was wrong I know I was wrong to marry Molly and then to keep it a secret But I loved you Nancy I only ever wanted to marry you</p>
<p>Still Nancy was silent looking down at her hands And God frey almost expected her to get up and say she would leave him and go to live with her father and sister She was so religious and so firm in her ideas of right and wrong</p>
<p>But at last she lifted her eyes to his and spoke She did not sound angry but only sad  Oh Godfrey why didn&#x27;t you tell me this long ago  I didn&#x27;t know Eppie was yours and so I re fused to adopt her Of course I&#x27;d accept your child into our home But oh Godfrey how sad to think we&#x27;ve spent all these years with no children Why didn&#x27;t you confess the truth before we married We could be so happy now with a beautiful daughter who would love me as her mother &#x27;tears were running down Nancy&#x27;s face But Nancy  cried Godfrey bitterly angry with himself   I couldn&#x27;t tell you everything I was in danger of losing you if I told you the truth</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know about that Godfrey I certainly never want ed to marry anyone else But it wasn&#x27;t worth doing wrong just so that you could marry me And our marriage hasn&#x27;t been as happy for you as you thought it would be There was a sad smile on Nancy&#x27;s face as she said the last words</p>
<p>Can you ever forgive me for what I&#x27;ve done Nancy</p>
<p>You have only hurt me a little Godfrey and you&#x27;ve been a good husband to me for fifteen years But it&#x27;s the other wom an who you&#x27;ve hurt the most and I don&#x27;t see how you can put that right</p>
<p>But we can take Eppie into our home now &#x27;said Godfrey</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be different now that she&#x27;s grown up &#x27;said Nancy shaking her head sadly  It&#x27;ll be more difficult for her to get used to us But it&#x27;s our duty to take care of your child and I&#x27;ll ask God to make her love me</p>
<p>Then we&#x27;ll go to the weaver&#x27;s cottage tonight &#x27;said God frey  and talk to Marner and Eppie about it</p>
<p>10 Eppie has to decide</p>
<p>That evening Silas was resting in his chair near the fire after the excitement of the day Eppie was sitting close to him holding both his hands and on the table was Silas&#x27;s lost gold He had put the coins in piles as he used to</p>
<p>You see that&#x27;s all I ever did in the long evenings before you came to me  he was telling Eppie  just count my gold I was only half alive in those days What a good thing the money was taken away from me I was killing myself with working all day and counting money half the night It wasn&#x27;t a healthy life And when you came with your yellow curls I thought you were the gold And then when I began to love you I didn&#x27;t want my gold any more  He stopped talking for a moment and looked at the money  The gold doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me now But perhaps if I ever lost you Eppie if you ever went away from me I&#x27;d need my gold again I&#x27;d feel lonely then and I&#x27;d think God had forgotten me and perhaps I&#x27;d go back to my bad old habits &#x27;there were tears in Eppie&#x27;s beautiful eyes but she did not have time to answer Silas as just then there was a knock on the door When she opened it Mr and Mrs Godfrey Cass came in</p>
<p>Good evening my dear &#x27;said Nancy taking Eppie&#x27;s hand gently  We&#x27;re sorry to come so late</p>
<p>Well Marner &#x27;said Godfrey as he and Nancy sat down  I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve got your money back and I&#x27;m very sorry it was one of my family who stole it from you  Whatever I can do for you I will to repay what I owe you and I owe you a lot  Marner &#x27;silas was always uncomfortable with important people like the young Squire  You don&#x27;t owe me anything sir You&#x27;ve already been very kind to me. And that money on the table is more than most working people can save in their whole life Eppie and I don&#x27;t need very much</p>
<p>Godfrey was impatient to explain why they had come  Yes you&#x27;ve done well these last sixteen years Marner taking care of Eppie here She looks pretty and healthy but not very strong. Don&#x27;t you think she should be a lady not a working woman Now Mrs Cass and I you know have no children and we&#x27;d like to adopt a daughter to live with us in our beauti-ful home and enjoy all the good things we&#x27;re used to In fact we&#x27;d like to have Eppie I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be glad to see her be come a lady and of course we&#x27;d make sure you have every thing you need. And Eppie will come to see you very often I expect</p>
<p>Godfrey did not find it easy to say what he felt and as a re sult his words were not chosen sensitively Silas was hurt and afraid His whole body trembled as he said quietly to Eppie af ter a moment  I won&#x27;t stand in your way my child Thank Mr and Mrs Cass It&#x27;s very kind of them</p>
<p>Eppie stepped forward She was blushing but held her head high  Thank you sir and madam But I can&#x27;t leave my father And I don&#x27;t want to be a lady  thank you &#x27;she went back to Silas&#x27;s chair and put an arm round his neck brushing the tears from her eyes</p>
<p>Godfrey was extremely annoyed He wanted to do what he thought was his duty And adopting Eppie would make him feel much less guilty about his past But Eppie you must agree  he cried  You are my daughter Marner Eppie&#x27;s my own child Her mother was my wife.</p>
<p>Eppie&#x27;s face went white  Silas who had been relieved by hearing Eppie&#x27;s answer to Godfrey now felt angry  Then sir  he answered bitterly  why didn&#x27;t you confess this sixteen years ago before I began to love her Why do you come to take her away now when it&#x27;s like taking the heart out of my body God gave her to me because you turned your back on her  And He considers her mine</p>
<p>I know I was wrong and I&#x27;m sorry &#x27;said Godfrey  But be sensible  Marner She&#x27;ll be very near you and will often come to see you She&#x27;ll feel just the same towards you</p>
<p>Just the same &#x27;said Silas more bitterly than ever  How can she feel the same We&#x27;re used to spending all our time to-gether We need each other</p>
<p>Godfrey thought the weaver was being very selfish  I think Marner  he said firmly  that you should consider what&#x27;s best for Eppie You shouldn&#x27;t stand in her way when she could have a better life I&#x27;m sorry but I think it&#x27;s my duty to take care of my own daughter</p>
<p>Silas was silent for a moment He was worried that perhaps Godfrey was right and that it was selfish of him to keep Eppie At last he made himself bring out the difficult words  All right I&#x27;ll say no more Speak to the child I won&#x27;t pre vent her from going</p>
<p>Godfrey and Nancy were relieved to hear this and thought that Eppie would now agree  Eppie my dear &#x27;said Godfrey  althought I haven&#x27;t been a good father to you so far I want to do my best for you now And my wife will be the best of mothers to you</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted a daughter my dear  added Nancy in her gentle voice</p>
<p>But Eppie did not come forward this time She stood by Silas&#x27;s side holding his hand in hers and spoke almost coldly  Thank you sir and madam  for your kind offer But I wouldn&#x27;t be happy if I left father He&#x27;d have nobody if I weren&#x27;t here Nobody shall ever come between him and me   But you must make sure Eppie &#x27;said Silas worriedly   that you won&#x27;t be sorry if you decide to stay with poor people You could have a much better life at the Red House   I&#x27;ll never be sorry father &#x27;said Eppie firmly  I don&#x27;t want to be rich if I can&#x27;t live with the people I know and love</p>
<p>Nancy thought she could help to persuade Eppie  What you say is natural my dear child &#x27;she said kindly  But there&#x27;s a duty you owe to your lawful father If he opens his home to you you shouldn&#x27;t turn your back on him</p>
<p>But I can&#x27;t think of any home except this one  cried Eppie tears running down her face  l&#x27;ve only ever known one father And I&#x27;ve promised to marry a working man who&#x27;ll live with us and help me take care of father</p>
<p>Godfrey looked at Nancy Let&#x27;s go  he said to her bitterly in a low voice</p>
<p>We won&#x27;t talk of this any more &#x27;said Nancy getting up We just want the best for you Eppie my dear and you too Marner Good night</p>
<p>Nancy and Godfrey left the cottage and walked home in the moonlight When they reached home Godfrey dropped into a chair Nancy stood near him waiting for him to speak After a few moments he looked up at her and took her hand</p>
<p>That&#x27;s ended  he said sadly</p>
<p>She kissed him and then said  Yes I&#x27;m afraid we can&#x27;t hope to adopt her if she doesn&#x27;t want to come to us</p>
<p>No &#x27;said Godfrey  it&#x27;s too late now I made mistakes in the past and I can&#x27;t put them right I wanted to be childless once Nancy and now I&#x27;ll always be childless</p>
<p>He thought for a moment and then spoke in a softer voice  But I got yon Nancy and yet I&#x27;ve been wanting something different all the time Perhaps from now on I&#x27;ll be able to ac cept our life better and we&#x27;ll be happier  The following spring there was a wedding in Raveloe The sun shone warmly as Eppie walked through the village towards the church with Silas Aaron and Dolly Eppie was wearing the beautiful white wedding dress she had always dreamed of which Nancy Cass had bought for her She was walking arm in arm with her father Silas</p>
<p>I promise nothing will change when I&#x27;m married father &#x27;she whispered to him as they entered the church  You know I&#x27;ll never leave you</p>
<p>There was quite a crowd of villagers outside the church to see the wedding Just then Miss Priscilla Lammeter and her fa ther drove into the village</p>
<p>Look father  cried Priscilla  How lucky We&#x27;re in time to see the weaver&#x27;s daughter getting married Doesn&#x27;t she look lovely I&#x27;m sorry Nancy couldn&#x27;t find a pretty little or phan girl like that to take care of</p>
<p>Yes my dear  agreed Mr Lammeter  Now that we&#x27;re all getting older it would be good to have a young one in the fam ily Unfortunately it&#x27;s too late now</p>
<p>They went into the Red House where Nancy was waiting for them They had come to spend the day with her because Godfrey was away on business and she would perhaps be lonely without him The Casses were not going to Eppie&#x27;s wedding</p>
<p>When the little wedding group came out of the church the villagers and Silas&#x27;s family all went to the Rainbow There a wonderful wedding lunch was waiting for them which had been ordered and paid for by Godfrey Cass</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very generous of the young Squire to pay for all this &#x27;said the landlord as he refilled the beer glasses   Well what would you expect &#x27;replied old Mr Macey sharply  Remember it was his own brother who stole the weaver&#x27;s gold And Mr Godfrey has always helped Master Marner with furniture and clothes and so on since young Ep-pie came to the cottage Well it&#x27;s only right to help a man like Master Marner And I&#x27;d like you all to remember I was the first to tell you I thought Master Marner was harmless and I was right Now let&#x27;s drink to the health of the happy young couple  And the villagers lifted their glasses and cried   To Eppie and Aaron</p>
<p>When the meal was over and the guests had begun to return to their homes Silas Eppie and her new husband walked slow-ly back to their cottage by the quarry It had been enlarged by Godfrey Cass&#x27;s workmen and was looking lovely in the late af ternoon sunshine</p>
<p>Oh father &#x27;said Eppie  What a pretty home ours is I think nobody could be happier than we are</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm
