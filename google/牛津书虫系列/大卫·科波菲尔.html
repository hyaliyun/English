<p>I was born at Blunderstone in Suffolk  in the east of England and was given my poor father&#x27;s name David Copperfield  Sadly  he never saw me He was much older than my mother when they married  and died six months before I was born  My father&#x27;s death made my beautiful young mother very unhappy  and she knew she would find life extremely difficult with a new baby and no husband  The richest and most important person in our family was my father&#x27;s aunt Miss Betsey Trotwood. She had in fact been married once  to a handsome young husband. But because he demanded money from her  and sometimes beat her  she decided they should separate He went abroad  and soon news came of his death. Miss Trotwood bought a small house by the sea  and lived there alone  with only one servant  She had not spoken to my father since his marriage  because she considered he had made a mistake in marrying a very young girl But just before I was born  when she heard that my mother was expecting a baby  she came to visit Blunder- stone.</p>
<p>It was a cold  windy Friday afternoon in March  My mother was sitting by the fire  feeling very lonely and unhappy  and crying a little. Suddenly a stern  strange-looking face appeared at the window.  Open the door   ordered the sternfaced lady  My mother was shocked but obeyed at once   You must be David Copper field&#x27;s wife  said the lady as she entered  I&#x27;m Betsey Trotwood  You&#x27;ve heard of me    Yes  whispered mother trembling   How young you are   cried Miss Betsey  Just a baby   My mother started sobbing again  I know I look like a child  I know I was young to be a wife  and I&#x27;m young to be a mother  But perhaps I&#x27;ll die before I become a mother    Come  come  answered Miss Betsey. Have some tea Then you&#x27;ll feel better What do you call your girl    My girl  I don&#x27;t know yet that it will be a girl  replied my mother miserably   No I don&#x27;t mean the baby I mean your servant</p>
<p>Her name&#x27;s Peggotty  Her first name&#x27;s Clara the same as mine  so I call her by her family name you see    What a terrible name  However  never mind  Peggotty  she called  going to the door  Bring Mrs Copperfield some tea at once   She sat down again and continued speaking  You were talking about the baby  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a girl  Now  as soon as she  s born    He  perhaps   said my mother bravely   Don  t be stupid  of course it  ll be a she I&#x27;m going to send her to school and educate her well  I want to prevent her from making the mistakes I&#x27;ve made in life   Miss Betsey looked quite angry as she said this  My mother said nothing as she was not feeling at all well. But tell me  were you and your husband happy  asked Miss Betsey</p>
<p>This made my poor mother feel worse than ever. I know I wasn&#x27;t very sensible about money or cooking or things like that   she sobbed. But we loved each other and he was helping me to learn and then he died Oh Oh  And she fell back in her chair  completely unconscious</p>
<p>Peggotty  who came in just then with the tea realized how serious the situation was  and took my mother upstairs to bed. The doctor arrived soon afterwards  and stayed all evening to take care of his patient.</p>
<p>At about midnight he came downstairs to the sitting room where Miss Betsey was waiting impatiently</p>
<p>Well doctor, what&#x27;s the news  How is she</p>
<p>The young mother is quite comfortable  madam   replied the doctor politely</p>
<p>But she  the baby  how is she   cried Miss Betsey</p>
<p>The doctor looked strangely at Miss Betsey. It&#x27;s a boy madam   he replied</p>
<p>Miss Betsey said nothing but walked straight out of the house  and never came back</p>
<p>That was how I was born. My early childhood was extremely happy  as my beautiful mother and kind Peggotty took care of me. But when I was about eight  a shadow passed over my happiness. My mother often went out walking in her best clothes  with a gentleman called Mr Murdstone  He had black hair  a big black moustache and an unpleasant smile  and seemed to be very fond of my mother. But I knew that Peggotty did not like him  A few months later Peggotty told me that my mother was going to have a short holiday with some friends. Meanwhile Peggotty and I would go to stay with her brother Daniel in Yarmouth on the east coast  for two weeks I was very excited when we climbed into the cart  although it was sad saying goodbye to my mother  Mr Murdstone was at her shoulder waving goodbye  as the driver called to his horse  and we drove out of the village  When we got down from the cart in Yarmouth after our journey Peggotty said   That&#x27;s the house Master David   I looked all round  but could only see an old ship on the sand. Is that that your brother&#x27;s house  I asked in delight. And when we reached it I saw it had doors and windows and a chimney just like a real house  I could not imagine a nicer place to live. Everything was clean and tidy  and smelt of fish  Now I was introduced to the Peggotty family There was Daniel Peggotty  a kind old sailor  Although he was not married  he had adopted two orphans  who lived with him and called him Uncle  Ham Peggotty was a large young man with a gentle smile and Emily was a beautiful blue-eyed little girl. They all welcomed Peggotty and me warmly  I spent a wonderfully happy two weeks there  playing all day on the beach with Emily and sleeping in my own little bed on the ship. I am sure I was in love with little Emily in my childish way  and I cried bitterly when we had to say goodbye at the end of the holiday  But on the way home to Blunderstone  Peggotty looked at me very worriedly. Master David my dear  she said suddenly in a trembling voice. I must tell you you&#x27;ll have to know now  While we&#x27;ve been away  your dear mother has married Mr Murdstone He&#x27;s your stepfather now   I was deeply shocked  I could not understand how my mother could have married that man And when we arrived home  I could not help showing my mother how very miserable I was  I went straight to my room and lay sobbing on my bed which made my poor mother very unhappy too  As she sat beside me  holding my hand  Mr Murdstone suddenly came in   What&#x27;s this  Chara  my love   he asked sternly  Remember you must be firm with the boy I&#x27;ve told you before you&#x27;re too weak with him     Oh yes Edward I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re right   my mother replied quickly  I&#x27;m very sorry  I&#x27;ll try to be firmer with him   And when she left the room  Mr Murdstone whispered angrily to me  David do you know what I&#x27;ll do if you don&#x27;t obey me  I&#x27;ll beat you like a dog   I was still very young and I was very frightened of him  If he had said one kind word to me  perhaps I would have liked and trusted him and my life would have been different. Instead  I hated him for the influence he had over my dear mother who wanted to be kind to me  but also wanted to please her new husband  That evening Mr Murdstone&#x27;s sister arrived to  help my mother in the house  A tall dark lady  with a stern  frowning face she looked and sounded very much like her brother I thought she was planning to stay with us for a long time  and I was right In fact she intended to stay for ever  She started work the next morning.  Now  Clara   she said firmly to my mother at breakfast  I am here to help you. You  re much too pretty and thoughtless to worry about the servants  the food and so on  So just hand me your keys to all the cupboards  and I&#x27;ll take care of everything for you   My poor mother just blushed looked a little ashamed and obeyed. From then on  Miss Murdstone took complete control of the house  keeping the keys hanging from her waist as she hurried through the house checking that everything was being done just as she wished.</p>
<p>2 David is sent away to school</p>
<p>I was very unhappy during this time. Mr Murdstone insisted on my studying  and so my mother gave me lessons  In the past she and I had enjoyed our studies together  and she had taught me a lot in her gentle way. But now both Mr and Miss Murdstone were present during my lessons  and somehow I could not concentrate or remember what I had learnt. My poor mother was very sympathetic and tried to encourage me sometimes even whispering the answer to me. But the Murdstones had sharp ears   Clara my love   Mr Murdstone used to say crossly. Remember Be firm You  re making the boy&#x27;s character worse by helping him like that    Oh Edward, I&#x27;m sorry, my mother replied, looking embarrassed and hanging her head like a guilty child  One morning when I arrived in the sittingroom as usual for my lesson I saw that Mr Murd stone had a thin stick in his hand. I could not take my eyes off it.</p>
<p>You must be very careful today  David,  he said with his unpleasant smile  holding the stick in both hands  I knew what would happen then. A terrible fear took hold of me  and all that I had learnt disappeared immediately from my memory  so that I could not answer any of my mother&#x27;s questions. Mr Murdstone got up from his chair.  Well David  he said heavily,  I think you&#x27;ve worried your mother enough today. We&#x27;ll go upstairs  boy. Come  and he picked up the stick. I heard my mother crying as we went upstairs.  Please Mr Murdstone  I cried.  Don&#x27;t beat me I&#x27;ve tried to learn really I have, sir   But he did not listen to me. In my bedroom he held my arms and started hitting me with the stick. I managed to get hold of his hand  and bit deep into it. He cried out angrily and began to hit me as hard as he could Above the noise of my screams  I could hear my mother and Peggotty crying outside the door. Then the next moment  he was gone. I heard him lock the door. And I was lying  sore and bleeding, on the floor. The whole house seemed suddenly very quiet. I stayed there for a time  without moving. In the evening Miss Murdstone brought me some bread and milk  which she left on the floor beside me frowning angrily at me as she went out. I was kept locked in that room for five days and nights and saw nobody except Miss Murdstone  who brought me food but never spoke to me. To a small boy  the five days seemed like years and I can still remember how frightened and guilty I felt  But during the fifth night I heard a strange noise at the key-hole. It was Peggotty trying to give me a message</p>
<p>Master David my dear  she whispered, sobbing  they are going to send you away to boarding school  Tomorrow    Oh Peggotty   I cried. Then I won&#x27;t see you and mother very often    No  my love. But don&#x27;t forget  I&#x27;ll take care of your mother. She needs her cross old Peggotty  I&#x27;ll stay with her although I hate these Murdstones. And remember David, I love you as much as I love your mother and more. And I&#x27;ll Write to you.   Thank you dear Peggotty  I whispered back, tears rolling down my face. Will you write to your brother too and Ham and little Emily, and tell them I&#x27;m not as bad as the Murdstones think  And send my love to them especially little Emily   Peggotty promised to do what I asked. The next morning Miss Murdstone told me that because of my wickedness I was going away to school She had already packed my case for me. My mother was only allowed to say a very quick goodbye to me  when the horse and cart arrived The driver put my case on the cart  and we drove slowly out of Blunderstone. I was still sobbing loudly when suddenly I saw Peggotty running after us on the road. The driver stopped and waited for her. With difficulty she climbed up onto the cart.</p>
<p>Here  Master David   she cried breathlessly. A little present from me and your dear mother Take care of yourself  my dear  She put a small purse and a paper bag into my hands and held me so close to her fat body that I thought I would never breathe again. Then she jumped down and ran back along the road to the village</p>
<p>As we continued our journey  I dried my tears and looked at what she had given me. The bag was full of Peggotty  s special cakes  and in the purse were eight bright shilling coins. Thinking of my mother and Peggotty made me start crying again but just then the driver, Mr Barkis, began to talk to me. He was a large red-faced man, who clearly found conversation difficult.</p>
<p>Did she make those cakes   he asked slowly  having finished the one that I had offered him.</p>
<p>You mean Peggotty  sir  Yes, she does all our cooking.</p>
<p>Does she   replied Mr Barkis with great interest. There was a long silence while he considered his next question</p>
<p>Does she have a young man  he asked  You know someone who wants to marry her</p>
<p>Peggotty A young man  I repeated surprised. Oh no,she&#x27;s never had any young men.</p>
<p>Ah   replied Mr Barkis looking very pleased. Again he thought for a long time before speaking.</p>
<p>Well  he said at last,  perhaps if you write to her will you be writing to her  You could give her a message from me. You could say  Barkis is willing   Would you do that</p>
<p>Barkis is willing    I repeated innocently  wondering what the message meant. Yes of course. But you could tell her yourself  Mr Barkis, when you return to Blunderstone tomorrow</p>
<p>No no  he said,   no,you just give her the message. Remember  Barkis is willing .  After this conversation Mr Barkis was completely silent for the rest of the journey. When we arrived in Yarmouth I bought paper at the hotel and wrote this letter to Peggotty  My dear Peggotty  I have arrived safely in Yarmouth. Barkis is willing. Please give my love to mother. Yours David  P.S. He says it&#x27;s important Barkis is willing.In Yarmouth I was put on the long distance coach to London and travelled all through the night. At the coach station in London I was collected by a teacher  Mr Mell, and taken to Salem House  the school which the Murdstones had chosen for me.</p>
<p>The school was a large old building with a dusty playground  surrounded by a high brick wall. It looked strangely deserted. I was very surprised to find that none of the boys were there  and was told that they were all on holiday  and that I had been sent there during the holidays as a punishment for my wickedness. The headmaster and teachers were on holiday too all except for Mr Mell, who had to look after me. I spent a whole month in that miserable place doing my lessons in the dirty  empty classroom, which smelt of old food and unwashed boys. Every evening I had to eat my supper with Mr Mell and then go straight to bed. The worst thing was the sign I had to wear round my neck. It said  BE CAREFUL HE BITES. I was only allowed to take it off when I went to bed. Although I was extremely lonely and unhappy at this time I was not looking forward to meeting all the other boys. I felt sure they would laugh at me and especially at the sign I was forced to wear. But one day Mr Mell told me that the headmaster  Mr Creakle, had returned, and wanted to see me. So I went trembling to his part of the house. I realized at once that Mr Creakle lived much more comfortably than the boys or the teachers. He was a small  fat man with a purple nose  who was sitting in an armchair with a bottle and a glass in front of him.</p>
<p>So  this is the boy who bites, is it   he asked unpleasantly. I know your stepfather  boy. He&#x27;s a man of strong character he is. He knows me,and I know him. Do you know me  Answer me boy  He pulled violently at my ear</p>
<p>Not yet  sir,  I answered, tears of pain in my eyes.  Ah but you soon will Oh yes, I have a strong character too you&#x27;ll see   He banged his hand hard on the table  I was very frightened but I made myself ask the question I had been considering for a whole month.  Please  sir, I&#x27;m very sorry for what I did to Mr Murdstone. Could could I take this sign off before the other boys see it   Mr Creakle gave a sudden terrible shout and jumped out of his chair. I did not wait to see whether he was going to hit me  but ran out of his room and hid in my bed for the next hour. However  the boys were not as cruel to me as I had feared. I made a friend almost immediately  a boy called Tommy Traddles  who was known to be the unluckiest boy in the school. I was also noticed  and even smiled on, by the great James Steerforth one of the oldest boys, at least six years older than me. He was a handsome intelligent, curly-haired young man  who had become an important figure at the school with great influence over the younger boys.</p>
<p>How much money have you got Copperfield   he asked me.</p>
<p>Eight shillings Steerforth  I answered remembering the present my mother and Peggotty had given me.</p>
<p>You&#x27;d better give it to me. I&#x27;ll take care of it for you   he offered in a friendly way.</p>
<p>I opened Peggotty&#x27;s purse and turned it upside-down into his hand</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#x27;d like to spend some of it now  he suggested smiling. A bottle of wine, a tin of biscuits, a few cakes  that sort of thing I can go out whenever I like, so I can buy it for you.   Ye-es that  s very kind of you,  I said, although I was a little worried that all my money would disappear. When we went upstairs to bed  I realized that all my money had been spent  as eight shillings  worth of food and drink was laid out on my bed in the moonlight. Of course I did not want to eat and drink it all by myself  so I invited Steerforth and the others to help themselves. The boys were very willing  and we spent a pleasant evening, sitting on our beds whispering to each other. I discovered that the boys all hated Salem House  which they considered one of the worst schools in the country. They especially hated Mr Creakle  who was in the habit of beating them regularly with a heavy stick which he carried with him at all times. The only boy he dared not beat was Steerforth. I admired Steerforth even more when I heard this. When we were all too tired to stay awake  Steerforth got up to go. Goodnight young Copperfield    he said, putting a hand on my head. I&#x27;ll take care of you</p>
<p>It  s very kind of you   I replied gratefully.</p>
<p>You haven  t got a sister  have you  he asked sleepily.  No  I haven&#x27;t,  I answered.  What a pity  If you had one  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d be a pretty, bright-eyed little girl. I would have liked to meet her.  I thought of him a lot that night with his laughing, hand-some face  and his careless, confident manner. I could never have imagined what a dark shadow he would throw over the lives of people who were dear to me. I stayed at Salem House for three more months. Although one or two of the teachers like Mr Mell, were kind to us boys and tried to teach us properly, we were too afraid of Mr Creakle and his stick to concentrate on our studies. But Tom-my Traddles and I cheered each other up if we were beaten and I was lucky enough to be friendly with the great Steerforth in spite of the difference in our ages. However  my home, even with the Murdstones there, seemed a much pleasanter place than school  and I was glad when the Christmas holidays arrived  and I was allowed to return to Blunderstone. I was a little surprised to find that my mother had a new baby  and I could see at once that she was not well. She looked tired and worried and very thin. But she and Peggotty were delighted to see me  although they dared not show it if the Murdstones were present. My stepfather and his sister seemed to hate me even more than before  if that were possible  and they made my life quite miserable whenever they could. In fact  I was almost pleased when it was time to return to school  and see Traddles and Steerforth again. As the cart drove away  I remember my mother standing outside our house with her baby in her arms, smiling sadly at me. That was the last time I saw her and that is how I shall always remember her.</p>
<p>3 David the orphan</p>
<p>Life went on as normal for me at school until my birthday two months later in March. I remember that day very well. It was cold icy weather, and we boys had to blow on our fingers and rub our hands to keep warm in the freezing classrooms. When a message came for me to go and see Mr Creakle  I thought that Peggotty must have sent me a birthday present and so I hurried gladly along to his room. But there I realized something unusual had happened because it was Mr Creakle  s wife who was waiting to speak to me.  David  my child,   she said kindly, holding my hand,  we all have to accept that our loved ones can die at any moment.  I looked at her  trying to understand what she meant.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry to tell you  she continued,  that your mother is dangerously ill.  There was a mist in front of my eyes  and suddenly burning tears ran down my face. I knew the truth.</p>
<p>Your mother is dead   she said. I was already sobbing loudly and I felt I was an orphan quite alone in the world. Mrs Creakle packed my case herself  and sent me home on the coach for the funeral. I did not realize at the time that I would never return to Salem House. When I arrived home Peggotty met me at the door, and we cried miserably in each other  s arms. Mr Murdstone seemed very sad  and did not speak to me at all. Miss Murdstone, however showed her usual firmness of character  which she and her brother were so proud of  by checking that I had brought all my clothes back from school. After that she showed no interest in me at all.There was a deathly stillness in the house. Peggotty took me up to the room where my dear mother&#x27;s dead body lay with my little brother, who had died a few hours after her. Everything was fresh and clean in the room  but I could not look at my mother&#x27;s lovely face, which would never smile at me again  without crying.  How did it happen Peggotty  I asked, sobbing.  She was ill for a long time  Master David. She got worse after the baby was born  you see. She was sometimes unhappy and forgetful  but she was always the same to me, her old Peggotty. Those two downstairs often spoke crossly to her and made her sad  but she still loved them  you know she was so sweet and loving I always sat beside her while she went to sleep. It made her feel better  she said. There was a short silence while Peggotty dried her eyes  then took both my hands in hers. On the last night she asked me for some water, and then gave me such a patient smile She looked so beautiful The sun was beginning to rise  and she put her head on my arm  on her stupid cross old Peggotty&#x27;s arm, and died like an innocent child going to sleep   After my mother&#x27;s funeral I began to wonder what would happen to me. The Murdstones did not even seem to notice that I was in the house. They had told Peggotty to leave as they did not what her as their servant any more so Peggotty was going to her brother&#x27;s in Yarmouth  until she decided what work to do next. She suggested taking me with her for a holiday  and to my surprise the Murdstones agreed. So next morning Mr Barkis appeared at the door with his cart  and Peggotty&#x27;s cases were put on it. We climbed up and sat beside him. Peggotty was naturally a little sad to leave her old home  where she had been so happy with my mother and me  and at first she cried a little. But when Mr Barkis saw her drying her eyes and looking more cheerful  he too began to look happier  and he whispered to me,  Barkis is willing You told her that   Aloud he said to Peggotty  Are you comfortable</p>
<p>Peggotty laughed and said that she was.</p>
<p>And are you comfortable Master David  be asked.</p>
<p>I said that I was. Mr Barkis was so pleased with this conversation that he repeated it many times during the journey and Peggotty and I both had to keep giving him the same answer.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Yarmouth and got down from the cart we said goodbye to Mr Barkis. Daniel and Ham Peggotty were waiting for us. Daniel and Ham were exactly the same as I remembered them cheerful and generous as ever, but little Emily seemed different somehow She was taller and prettier  but she did not want to play with me  or spend her time with me. I was rather disappointed  because I still considered she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen  and I thought I was in love with her. Daniel and Ham were very proud of her intelligence and beauty  and just smiled when she laughingly refused to sit next to me. But they all listened with interest to my stories of school life at Salem House. I told them about the other boys  especially the handsome, clever Steerforth. I admired him so much that I could not stop myself telling them all about him. Suddenly I noticed that Emily was listening eagerly  her blue eyes shining and a smile on her lips. She blushed when she saw that we were all looking at her  and hid her face behind her hands.  Emily&#x27;s like me  said Peggotty kindly,  and would like to see David&#x27;s friend Mr Steerforth.  The days passed happily although Emily and I did not play together as we had done before. Mr Barkis was a frequent visitor and soon Peggotty explained to me that she had decided to marry him.  I  ll love you just as much  David, my dear, when I&#x27;m married   she told me  holding me close to her. And I&#x27;ll be able to come and see you in the cart any time I like. Barkis is a good man and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be happy with him. He  s got a nice little house and I&#x27;ll keep a little bedroom there for you to use whenever you want. You&#x27;ll always be welcome to come and stay  So when I returned to Blunderstone  Peggotty had become Mrs Barkis  and I was glad to think of her in her own house with a husband to take care of her. At home  my stepfather and his sister did not seem pleased to see me  and were clearly trying to find a way of getting rid of me. As they considered school too expensive  they finally arranged for me to start work  although I was still only ten years old, and very small for my age. I was sent to London to work in a warehouse in the east of the city  near the river. My job was to wash bottles  which would then be filled with wine  or to pack the filled bottles in cases. I was paid only six shillings a week. There were several other boys who worked with me but I was the only one who had been to school. All the warehouse workers were coarse  rough people, who were used to working in dirty conditions for long hours. No words can describe the horror I felt  when I realized what my life was going to be like from now on. I was deeply ashamed at having such a job and I was also afraid that I would forget everything I had learnt from my mother and my teachers. I would never find friends like Traddles or Steerforth  or be able to get a better position in life. It was an extremely unhappy time for me. My stepfather had asked Mr Quinion  the manager, to find me somewhere to stay in London so at the end of my first day I was called to Mr Quinion&#x27;s office and introduced to an important-looking  rather fat, middle-aged man with a head as bald as an egg. His name was Mr Micawber and he offered me a spare room in the house he was renting with his family. I agreed to take it  and Mr Micawber and I walked home together. The Micawbers were obviously very poor  but tried hard not to let this show. The house had several floors of rather dirty empty rooms with very little furniture. Mrs Micawber was a thin tired-looking woman with a baby in her arms. The baby was one of twins and in all my experience of the family, I never saw Mrs Micawber without at least one of the twins. They also had a four-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter. Their only servant was a young orphan girl.   I never thought   Mrs Micawber told me sadly as she showed me my room   when I lived with Mother and Father, before I was married that I would ever be as poor as this. But as Mr Micawber is for the moment in difficulties I must of course accept the situation. I&#x27;m afraid he owes a lot of money but his creditors will just have to wait  You can&#x27;t get blood out of a stone  nor can anyone get any money at all out of Mr Micawber at present   I soon realized that neither Mr nor Mrs Micawger had ever been able to manage money.The little that Mr Micawber earned was not enough  either to keep his creditors happy, or to pay for the needs of his growing family. So his creditors were constantly at the door  demanding payment, and meals were rather irregular in the Micawber house. Mr and Mrs Micawber&#x27;s moods varied according to the situation. One moment Mr Micawber looked extremely miserable and depressed the next he was brushing his shoes and singing a song before going out. Mrs Micawber&#x27;s character was similar to her hus band&#x27;s. Sometimes I came home to find her lying on the floor with her hair undone  looking wild and desperate, but an hour later she was cheerfully eating a good supper. I lived with these kind people for several months  and became very fond of them. I bought my own food out of my wages because I knew the Micawbers hardly ever had enough for themselves and I lived mostly on bread and cheese. As they were so short of money  once or twice I offered to lend them a few shillings which they refused to accept.But at last Mr Micawber&#x27;s creditors became tired of waiting for their money and went to the police, who arrested him for debt. He was taken to the King&#x27;s Prison  and asked me to visit him there. When I arrived I was shown to his room, where he was waiting for me. He seemed quite brokenhearted  and even cried a little.</p>
<p>This is a black day for me Copperfield   he sobbed. I hope my mistakes will be a warning to young people like you Remember if a man earns twenty pounds a year, and spends nineteen pounds and nineteen shillings  the result is happiness. But if he spends twenty pounds and one shilling the result is misery  By the way  Copperfield could you lend me a shilling for some beer  Mrs Micawber will pay you back as soon as you arrive home.   And when the beer arrived  he appeared much more cheerful. We had a pleasant evening telling stories and jokes. He stayed in prison for several weeks  and I visited him regularly I was delighted to hear on one of my visits that he would soon be free  as his creditors had unwillingly accepted the fact that he had no way of paying his debts. I gave the news to Mrs Micawber when I returned home. We celebrated by sharing our supper and a glass of wine together.  May I ask what you will do  madam, when Mr Micawber is free  I asked politely.  My family   said Mrs Micawber grandly,  believe that Mr Micawber should move to the country  to Devon, and carry on his business interests there. Mr Micawber is a very clever man  Master Copperfield.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure he is   I agreed.  Although they haven&#x27;t found anything exactly right for him yet my family think he should be ready, in Devon, in case something turns up. She put down her empty glass.  And will you be going with him  madam   I asked.  I must I will  Mrs Micawber&#x27;s voice rose to a scream. He is my life  My love My husband  The father of my children  I will never desert Mr Micawber  You can&#x27;t ask me to desert him   I felt very uncomfortable as I had not asked her to desert him at all  but she soon became calm again and finished her supper.I was becoming used to the Micawbers  changes of mood. I now realized that when the Micawbers left London  as they were planning to do  I would be very lonely in the city. I still hated my work in the warehouse  and wanted to make a better life for myself.I thought about it for a long time  and decided there was only one thing I could do. I would try to find my one surviving relation my father&#x27;s aunt, Miss Betsey Trotwood  and ask her to help me. I knew she lived somewhere near Dover in Kent.I could go there by coach, be-cause Peggotty had once sent me ten shillings to keep in case I ever needed it.The time had come to use that money.</p>
<p>4 David and his aunt</p>
<p>So after helping the Micawbers to pack their few clothes and waving goodbye to them at the coach sta-tion on their way to Devon I went to the warehouse for my last day at work I did not tell anyone I would not be coming back the following week. In the evening I packed my case and put the ten shillings in the little purse Peggotty had once given me I looked around for someone to help me with my case  which was rather heavy for me, and saw a tall young man with a horse and cart passing by</p>
<p>Could you please take my case to the coach station   I asked him politely  The young man put the case into his cart. Then  looking round quickly to make sure there were no witnesses  he pushed me roughly against the wall and took my purse out of my trembling hand. Before I could say a word  he had driven the horse and cart down the road and out of sight round the corner.I knew I would never see him  my case or my ten shillings again  I sat down on the pavement and cried. Now I had lost ev erything I owned in the world  and had no money for the coach fare to Dover In the end I decided I would have to walk there  and I started the long journey. It took me six days to cover the hundred kilometres  as I got tired very easily, and had to rest I sold my jacket for a shilling so that I could buy bread and milk on the way and at night I slept in disused farm buildings or under trees Sometimes I was afraid of the dangerous looking beggars and thieves I met on the road but I knew I had to keep going As I walked I thought of my mother&#x27;s gentle pretty face I felt sure she would approve of what I was doing and that encouraged me to continue</p>
<p>But when I arrived in Dover it seemed a much larger town than I had imagined I spent a whole morning asking people if they knew where Miss Betsey Trotwood lived Finally I found someone who recognized the name and showed me the way to her house I stood at her front door in the neat little garden for a few moments trembling with fear and wondering what my aunt would think of me My face and hands were dirty my hair was unbrushed and my clothes were torn and dusty Perhaps she wouldn&#x27;t even want to invite me into her house</p>
<p>Just then a handsome but strict looking grey haired woman came out of the door towards me I knew she must be my aunt</p>
<p>Go away &#x27;she said crossly  I don&#x27;t allow anyone to walk on my grass</p>
<p>Please madam  I said bravely  please aunt</p>
<p>WHAT  cried Miss Betsey in great surprise</p>
<p>Please aunt I&#x27;m your nephew</p>
<p>Good heavens  she cried and sat down rather suddenly on the grass</p>
<p>I&#x27;m David Copper field your nephew&#x27;s son of Blunder stone in Suffolk where you came on the night I was born and saw my dear mother I&#x27;ve been very unhappy since she died My stepfather sent me to work in London and I hated it and ran away and someone stole my case and my money and I&#x27;ve had to walk all the way and I haven&#x27;t slept in a bed for six nights  Here my selfcontrol broke and I fell to the ground sobbing bitterly</p>
<p>My aunt jumped to her feet picked me up and took me into her sitting-room where she mixed some medicine in a glass and made me drink it She also wrapped me in a large blanket and put me on her sofa Then she rang the bell for her servant Janet</p>
<p>Please ask Mr Dick to come here Janet  she said</p>
<p>A tall grey haired pleasant looking gentleman entered a few minutes later laughing rather strangely to himself</p>
<p>Now Mr Dick  said my aunt firmly  don&#x27;t be a fool because we all know you&#x27;re intelligent  Mr Dick looked very serious at once  No doubt you remember that I had a nephew David Copperfield Well this is his son He has run away</p>
<p>Oh really David&#x27;s son Run away Well  said Mr Dick</p>
<p>Now the question is Mr Dick what shall I do with him</p>
<p>Well  Mr Dick looked vacantly at me and then sudden ly his eyes shone  If I were you I would wash him</p>
<p>Well done Mr Dick You always have the right answer  said my aunt delightedly</p>
<p>And so they washed me and gave me clean clothes and deli cious food While I was eating my aunt stared at me occa sionally whispering Good heavens  to herself When she could see that I felt better she asked me question after ques tion and I told her the story of my life</p>
<p>Good heavens  she said again when I had finished  Why did your poor mother marry again What a terrible mis take</p>
<p>Perhaps she was in love  suggested Mr Dick smiling his rather foolish smile</p>
<p>In love  said Miss Betsey crossly  Perhaps the poor silly girl thought she was in love But now Mr Dick another question What should we do with the boy</p>
<p>Well &#x27;said Mr Dick thinking Then an idea suddenly came to him  You should put him to bed</p>
<p>Thank you again Mr Dick for your common sense  said my aunt happily  Janet put the boy to bed</p>
<p>And so in a comfortable clean little bed in a pleasant airy room at the top of Miss Betsey Trotwood&#x27;s house I floated away into the world of my dreams</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning I bravely asked my aunt  Are you have you what&#x27;s going to happen to me</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve written to your stepfather  she replied</p>
<p>Oh Are you going to send me back to the Murdstones Please don&#x27;t aunt Please let me stay here  I cried trembling</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do yet  We&#x27;ll have to wait and see  she answered firmly</p>
<p>This news made me very depressed but there was nothing I could do about it and my aunt soon began to talk about some thing else</p>
<p>What do you think of Mr Dick child</p>
<p>He looks a little well mad Is he mad aunt</p>
<p>Well his family called him mad and wanted to lock him up for ever But I met him and thought I still think he&#x27;s an extremely sensible intelligent person So I offered to take care of him and he&#x27;s lived in my house for ten years Nobody knows what useful advice he&#x27;s given me I trust him com pletely</p>
<p>When I heard how generous my aunt had been to poor harmless Mr Dick I began to understand her character better In spite of her stern appearance and frequent crossness she was very kind to people who needed her help I hoped she would be kind to me</p>
<p>Several days later I was looking out of the sitting room window when I saw Mr and Miss Murdstone riding into my aunt&#x27;s garden My aunt had seen them too and hurried out waving her umbrella angrily at them and shouting  Go away Don&#x27;t ride on my grass Who do you think you are Go away I tell you</p>
<p>Aunt  I cried out  They&#x27;re Mr and Miss Murdstone</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care  she shouted  Nobody is allowed to ride on my grass  And she went back into her house banging the door behind her The Murdstones had to lead their horses out of the garden and then return to ring the doorbell They looked very uncomfortable and unsure of themselves Janet showed them into the sitting room where my aunt Mr Dick and I were waiting</p>
<p>Miss Trotwood  began Mr Murdstone stepping forward</p>
<p>Excuse me  said my aunt sharply  I imagine you are the Mr Murdstone who married my nephew&#x27;s widow In my opinion it would have been much better if you had never mar ried the poor Child</p>
<p>I agree with you Miss Trotwood  said Miss Murdstone smiling falsely  My brother would certainly have been happi er if he hadn&#x27;t married her because I consider poor dear Clara was in fact just a child</p>
<p>Fortunately  said my aunt  you and I madam are too old and plain for anyone to say that about us</p>
<p>Miss Murdstone did not seem eager to agree to this Her brother however wanted to get down to business</p>
<p>Miss Trotwood  he said a little crossly  having received your letter I&#x27;ve come to explain to you in case you haven&#x27;t realized it yet that this boy is extremely wicked and violent Both my sister and I have tried to change his character but sadly we have failed</p>
<p>I must add  said Miss Murdstone  that of all the boys in the world I believe this is the worst boy</p>
<p>I see  said my aunt  Now tell me has David inherited any money from his father or mother</p>
<p>No madam  answered Mr Murdstone  My dear Clara naturally trusted me to take care of David and I&#x27;m ready to do that if he comes back with me now But I alone shall de cide what to do with him Miss Trotwood understand that I am here for the first and last time to take him away If you decide to keep him with you you keep him for ever</p>
<p>What do you say David  asked my aunt turning to me</p>
<p>Please don&#x27;t let me go with them aunt  I begged  They&#x27;ve always been unkind to me and they made my mother very unhappy I&#x27;ll be so miserable if I have to go back with them</p>
<p>What do you think Mr Dick  asked my aunt</p>
<p>Mr Dick thought for a moment  Get a suit of clothes made for him immediately  he said</p>
<p>What would I do without you Mr Dick  asked my aunt shaking his hand enthusiastically Then she turned to Mr Murdstone</p>
<p>You&#x27;d better go I&#x27;ll keep the boy and take my chance with him I don&#x27;t believe a word of your story Do you think I don&#x27;t know how you broke that poor girl&#x27;s heart And how you hated her son and punished him for it I can see by your face that I&#x27;m right  We all stared at Mr Murdstone It was true that his face was white and he was breathing fast  Good bye sir and goodbye to you too madam  added my aunt turning suddenly to Miss Murdstone  If I see you riding on my grass again I&#x27;ll knock your hat right off your head</p>
<p>The Murdstones said nothing in reply to these fierce words but walked quickly out of the house</p>
<p>Thank you thank you aunt  I cried  I&#x27;ll do my best to make you proud of me  and I kissed her many times</p>
<p>Mr Dick you and I will adopt this boy together  said my aunt her stern expression softening into a smile</p>
<p>And so a new life began for me I was soon able to forget the warehouse and the Murdstones in learning to please my aunt and to play games with Mr Dick who spent much of his time with me</p>
<p>But one day my aunt suggested that I should go to boarding school in Canterbury I was delighted as I was eager to con tinue my studies and Canterbury was very near my aunt&#x27;s home in Dover So the next day my aunt and I went to Can terbury where I admired the beautiful old buildings in the an cient city centre</p>
<p>Is it a large school aunt  I asked politely</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t decided which school you&#x27;ll go to yet  she replied  First we&#x27;re going to ask my old friend Mr Wickfield&#x27;s advice about it He lives and works in Canterbury you see</p>
<p>Soon we stopped in front of a very old house with a very clean front doorstep and fresh white curtains at the windows A strange-looking person dressed in black with short red hair and a very thin white face came out to meet us I thought he must be a servant He was about fifteen but looked much older</p>
<p>Is Mr Wickfield at home Uriah Heep  asked my aunt</p>
<p>He is madam  replied Uriah smiling unpleasantly He showed us into the sitting-room where I noticed two large paintings on the wall one of a grey-haired gentleman and the other of a lady with a sweet gentle face Just then a gentle man entered the room looking a little older than his picture I soon discovered he was Mr Wickfield my aunt&#x27;s lawyer</p>
<p>Mr Wickfield  said my aunt  this is my nephew I have adopted him and I want to send him to a good boarding school here in Canterbury Can you help me find a school for him</p>
<p>Mr Wickfield thought for a moment  There&#x27;s a very good school I can recommend Dr Strong&#x27;s but the boy can&#x27;t board there and it&#x27;s too far to travel from Dover every day However he could live here if you liked in my house There&#x27;s plenty of room for him</p>
<p>That&#x27;s very kind of you Mr Wickfield I&#x27;ll pay you for his food of course  said my aunt</p>
<p>Come and meet Agnes who takes care of everything and manages the house  said Mr Wickfield We all went upstairs to another sitting-room prettily furnished where a girl of my own age was sitting On her face I saw immediately the beau tiful calm expression of the lady in the painting downstairs and I knew she must be Mr Wickfield&#x27;s daughter Agnes When I saw the way Mr Wickfield looked at Agnes and held her hand I realized that she was the only thing that made life worth living for him The lady in the painting was her mother who had died some years before and Agnes was now in complete charge of the house She welcomed me warmly as a guest and showed me the comfortable bedroom I would sleep in My aunt was very happy to leave me in the care of Mr Wickfield and his daughter</p>
<p>I must leave now David  she told me  Mr Wickfield will take you to school tomorrow and make all the arrange ments  I&#x27;m sure you will work hard and do well</p>
<p>Thank you aunt  I said trying not to cry  And give my love to Mr Dick And thank you again</p>
<p>When she had gone I dried my tears and spent a pleasant evening with the Wickfields We ate supper and talked in the pretty little sitting room Agnes played the piano and tried to amuse her father but he often looked serious and rather sad During the evening he drank a good deal of wine I wondered why he seemed unhappy</p>
<p>The next day I had my first experience of a well organized school It could not have been more different from Salem House The headmaster Dr Strong was a gentle kind man who enjoyed teaching and never punished anybody I soon made friends with the other boys and as time went on with the teachers too But although I liked school very much I was always happy to return to the Wickfields quiet house every evening There Agnes used to help me with my studies and listen sympathetically to my problems and her father always seemed pleased to see me I often wrote to my aunt and Peg gotty and Mr Dick came to visit me once a week</p>
<p>The strangest person in my new life was Uriah Heep Soon after I arrived in Canterbury we had a conversation one evening He was doing a lot of Mr Wickfield&#x27;s work and was working late in his small office just off the hall of the Wick fields house</p>
<p>Come in come in Master Copperfield  he cried when he saw me passing the door I entered and found him reading a large dusty book and making careful notes in a notebook</p>
<p>What are you studying Uriah  I asked politely</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to be a lawyer  he replied rubbing his thin hands together and smiling his oily smile</p>
<p>You&#x27;re Mr Wickfield&#x27;s assistant aren&#x27;t you Perhaps one day you&#x27;ll be his partner  I said trying to make conversation</p>
<p>Oh no Master Copperfield  cried Uriah rolling his eyes upwards  I could never rise so high No I&#x27;m much too humble for that But thank you Master Copperfield for thinking kindly of me And may I say that if ever you have the time and I&#x27;m sure a young gentleman like you is much too busy to spare the time for a poor person like me  my mother and I would be glad to offer you a cup of tea at our humble home</p>
<p>Of course if I have time  I answered and left the room quickly I did not feel comfortable with him for some reason</p>
<p>But the following week he invited me to tea again and I did not want to appear rude so I agreed That evening he and I walked to the small house where he lived with his mother It was a warm day and we were drinking our tea near the open door when a gentleman I recognized passed by It was Mr Mi cawber He saw me sitting near the door and called out  Cop perfield Is it really you</p>
<p>I was delighted to see him again and Mrs Heep invited him in for some tea I had to introduce him to the Heeps but I did not think that Uriah would be a good influence on Mr Micaw ber However I was interested to discover that the Micawbers were now living in Canterbury as nothing had turned up in Devon They seemed to be very short of money again and surrounded by creditors as usual I left the Heeps house as soon as possible taking Mr Micawber with me as I did not want him to tell Uriah all about my life at the warehouse in London</p>
<p>And so the years passed I learnt everything that Dr Strong and his teachers could teach me and at seventeen came to the end of my schooldays My aunt suggested that before decid ing what profession to choose I should spend a month in Lon don or travelling round the country This would give me time to consider my next step I agreed enthusiastically and al though I was sorry to say goodbye to my sweet friend Agnes and her father I was looking forward to leading the life of an independent young gentleman</p>
<p>5 David meets old friends again</p>
<p>I decided to go to London first to stay at a hotel for a few nights and see all the sights of that great city I knew it would be very different from the last time I was in London when I was working at the warehouse Now I was adult and educated and had money</p>
<p>The hotel I chose was called the Golden Cross and because I looked so young I was given a very small dark room in the roof But I did not feel confident enough to complain</p>
<p>That evening I was returning from the theatre when I recognized someone going into the hotel I could not prevent my self from saying at once  Steerforth Do you remember me</p>
<p>He stared at me for a moment Then he cried  Good heavens It&#x27;s little Copperfield</p>
<p>I was so delighted to see him that I held both his hands saying  My dear Steerforth you have no idea how pleased I am to see you again  I remembered how much I had admired him and all my love for him came back I had to brush away the tears from my eyes</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t cry Copperfield old boy  he said kindly  I&#x27;m glad to see you too What are you doing here</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve just finished school and my aunt has sent me to Lon don to look around before deciding on a profession What about you Steerforth</p>
<p>Well I&#x27;m studying at Oxford University but nothing ex citing ever happens there That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in London for a few days But it&#x27;s boring here too isn&#x27;t it</p>
<p>In London  I asked surprised  I think it&#x27;s wonderful There&#x27;s so much to do and see I&#x27;ve just been to the theatre the actors were excellent and</p>
<p>David David  laughed Steerforth  It does me good to see your fresh innocent face so full of excitement Now let me see which room are staying in</p>
<p>Number 44 It&#x27;s rather high up  I confessed blushing</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve put you in number 44 I&#x27;ll soon change that  And when Steerforth complained to the manager I was imme diately given a large airy comfortable room on the first floor next to his That night as I fell asleep I thought happily of the next few days which Steerforth and I were planning to spend together</p>
<p>A week passed very quickly with visits to the theatre the museums and the zoo We went sightseeing riding swimming and boating Steerforth was the perfect companion to have and I admired him even more than before In fact I loved him with all my heart</p>
<p>One day I said to him  You know Steerforth I really must go and visit my mother&#x27;s old servant  Peggotty She was very good to me when I was a child</p>
<p>Yes David I remember you told me She lives in Yarmouth now  doesn&#x27;t she Why don&#x27;t we go there together</p>
<p>Oh yes Steerforth You&#x27;d enjoy meeting her brothef and all the family They&#x27;re very kind good people</p>
<p>Even if they are only working people  said Steerforth I looked quickly at him to see what he meant but he was smiling at me so I knew he was joking and I smiled too</p>
<p>We travelled to Yarmouth by coach and when we arrived Steerforth stayed at the hotel while I went to Barkis&#x27;s house to find Peggotty When I knocked at the door Peggotty opened it and did not recognize me for a moment I had continued to write to her regularly but we had not seen each other for seven years and I was no longer the small boy she remembered But when she realized I was her Master David she sobbed and sobbed with delight holding me in her arms as she had always done Soon she was calmer and we talked about the events of the last few years I heard that she was very happy with Mr Barkis who however was ill in bed at the time She was so pleased to see me that she insisted I should sleep at her house during my stay in Yarmouth in the little bedroom she had al ways kept for me</p>
<p>The next day I took Steerforth with me to visit Daniel Peg gotty It was a dark and windy winter evening As we came closer to the old boat we heard happy voices and laughter in side I opened the door and suddenly I was surrounded by Daniel Ham and Emily all looking very surprised</p>
<p>Look It&#x27;s Master David Look how he&#x27;s grown</p>
<p>And for a moment we were all shaking hands and talking and laughing at the same time I did not forget to introduce Steerforth They welcomed him warmly as my best friend</p>
<p>Well  cried Daniel Peggotty his large face red and shin ing with delight  It&#x27;s wonderful Master David that you two gentlemen have come here tonight of all nights The best night of my life Because tonight gentlemen my little Emily  and he took Emily&#x27;s small white hand in his rough red one and placed it on his heart  has agreed to become Ham&#x27;s wife</p>
<p>I congratulate you with all my heart  said Steerforth politely to Ham without taking his eyes off Emily who was blushing prettily</p>
<p>Master David knows how I love this girl  continued old Daniel  and my dearest wish was for her to have a good husband to take care of her  And there&#x27;s no one I trust more than Ham He&#x27;s only a rough sailor like me but he&#x27;s honest and sincere and I know she&#x27;ll come to no harm while he lives</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ham was blushing too I did not know what to say unsure whether I still loved Emily and was therefore jealous of Ham or whether I was glad they were going to be happy together But steerforth always knew the right thing to say and with a few well-chosen words he made us all feel much more comfortable</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the evening very pleasantly telling stories and singing songs and it was midnight when Steerforth and I left the old boat</p>
<p>Well  said Steerforth to me as we walked across the sand in the cold night air  What a lovely girl And what a coarse young man she&#x27;s engaged to</p>
<p>I was shocked by these unexpectedly cold words But when I turned to him and saw him smiling I replied warmly  Ah Steerforth You pretend to laugh at people who are poorer or less educated than yourself but I&#x27;ve just seen you spend the whole evening with the Peggotty family making them happy I know you understand and love them and I admire you all the more for it</p>
<p>He stopped and looked at me saying rather sadly  David you&#x27;re serious aren&#x27;t you I wish I were as good as you</p>
<p>For the next two weeks I was often with Peggotty and Barkis while Steerforth went sailing or fishing with Daniel and Ham or found other things to do so I did not see very much of him Finally we decided to return to London</p>
<p>While we were travelling back on the coach I turned to say something and was surprised to see how miserable he looked</p>
<p>Oh David  he said unhappily  I wish I could control myself better I hate myself sometimes</p>
<p>Steerforth What can you mean  I cried  You&#x27;re the best the most intelligent the kindest of men</p>
<p>Thank you David  he said shaking his head  but you don&#x27;t know how bad I am</p>
<p>Bad  I repeated  My dear Steerforth Don&#x27;t say that I know your character well and I&#x27;m proud to call you my friend</p>
<p>In a little while his mood changed and he became cheerful again I soon forgot his words but I remembered them later</p>
<p>In London I discovered that my aunt had arrived at the Colden Cross Hotel and had booked a room there for several days We were delighted to see each other and had a long conversation that evening She had come to ask me a particular question</p>
<p>David  she said very seriously  I&#x27;ve been thinking about your future profession How would you feel about becoming a lawyer</p>
<p>I thought for a moment  Well aunt it sounds a very good idea I confess I hadn&#x27;t considered it before but I think I&#x27;d like it</p>
<p>Very good  said my aunt jumping up  In that case let&#x27;s go immediately to see Mr Spenlow He&#x27;s a partner in an important law firm and I think he&#x27;ll agree to train you We&#x27;ll have to pay him of course but after several years you&#x27;ll be a properly trained lawyer and be able to earn your own money</p>
<p>And so we carried out this plan My aunt paid Mr Spenlow&#x27;s firm a thousand pounds and I promised to work hard and do my best to become a successful lawyer Before she returned to Dover my aunt rented a small flat for me at the top of a house near the lawcourts and I moved in at once</p>
<p>At first it seemed very exciting to walk through the busy streets after a long day in the courts or at Mr Spenlow&#x27;s dusty office and know that I had my own home to return to But when I had climbed up all the stairs and entered my sitting room it no longer seemed so exciting In fact my flat looked empty and depressing So after two days of loneliness I was very glad to receive my first visitor Steerforth and because I was so happy to see him I invited him and two friends of his to dinner the next evening</p>
<p>As it was my first dinner party I did not know what to buy but I ordered cooked dishes of chicken and fish from the restaurant bought cheese and fruit from the market and had a large number of bottles of wine delivered I was quite fright ened by how much money I had spent but when Steerforth and his friends arrived I soon became more cheerful The party was a great success and we all enjoyed ourselves very much We ate and drank and smoked and drank again I was constantly opening bottles of wine and became unusually talkative I began to feel rather strange and when I caught sight of myself in a mirror I seemed very pale I had to confess to myself that I looked drunk</p>
<p>Someone suggested going to the theatre and in a kind of mist we left my flat and walked through the streets Steerforth was holding my arm and laughing Then a man in a little box looked out of the fog and took money from somebody Soon we were sitting high up in a very hot very crowded theatre There were bright lights and there was music but I could not understand what anyone was saying and the whole building seemed to swim in front of my eyes</p>
<p>Then someone suggested going to visit some friends in an other part of the theatre so we went downstairs Suddenly I saw quite clearly Agnes Wickfield sitting with a lady and gentleman She was looking at me with a surprised expression on her face</p>
<p>Good heavens  I cried  Agnes You&#x27;re in London</p>
<p>Quiet  she whispered  People are trying to listen to the actors You&#x27;ll disturb them  Then she added kindly  David please do what I say Ask your friends to take you home</p>
<p>I had always taken Agnes&#x27;s advice and I did so this time I do not remember how I got home but I do remember Steer forth helping me to undress and get into bed What a terrible sleepless night I spent How ill I felt How dry my mouth was But the next morning I felt even worse I was so miser able and ashamed that I had been so stupid and that Agnes had seen me drunk I could not even apologize to her because I did not know where she was staying in London I spent the whole day with my head in my hands in my dirty smoky room surrounded by empty wine bottles</p>
<p>But the next day a note was delivered to my flat It was from Agnes asking me to visit her at the house where she was staying I went straight there after my day&#x27;s work at the office</p>
<p>She looked so quiet and good and reminded me so much of my happy schooldays in Canterbury that I could not help crying</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so sorry Agnes  I said  that you saw me like that I wish I were dead</p>
<p>David don&#x27;t be unhappy  she said cheerfully  You know you can trust me and I&#x27;ll always be your friend</p>
<p>I took her hand and kissed it  Agnes you&#x27;re my good angel</p>
<p>She shook her head  No David but if I were I&#x27;d warn you to stay away from your bad angel</p>
<p>My dear Agnes  I cried  Do you mean Steerforth</p>
<p>I do David  she replied looking firmly at me</p>
<p>Agnes you&#x27;re wrong He is my trusted friend He helps and guides me It wasn&#x27;t his fault that I got drunk you know</p>
<p>I wasn&#x27;t thinking of that I judge him from what you&#x27;ve told me about him and your character and his influence over you  Agnes spoke very seriously and her words went straight to my heart  I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m right You&#x27;ve made a dangerous friend David because you&#x27;re so trusting Please remember what I say and forgive me for saying it</p>
<p>I will if you forgive me for getting drunk</p>
<p>Agnes agreed smiling and then said suddenly  Have you seen Uriah Heep</p>
<p>No  I replied  Is he in London What&#x27;s he doing here</p>
<p>I&#x27;m worried David  answered Agnes with sadness in her beautiful eyes  I think he&#x27;s going to be Father&#x27;s partner</p>
<p>I remembered Uriah Heep&#x27;s oily smile and how uncomfort able he always used to make me feel</p>
<p>What That creature He&#x27;s so unpleasant You must pre vent your father from agreeing to it Agnes</p>
<p>Agnes smiled miserably  My poor father has no choice You know how unhappy he has often been And of course you&#x27;ve seen him drinking You see he loved my mother very much and when she died he didn&#x27;t care so much about his work That&#x27;s when he started drinking Uriah&#x27;s very clever he knows all this and he&#x27;s been very useful to Father doing all the work that Father had forgotten or didn&#x27;t want to do Father really needs Uriah now to keep his business going And Uriah himself pretends to be humble and grateful but in fact he&#x27;s in a strong position and is insisting on becoming a partner Father is ashamed of himself but he has to agree Poor Father I&#x27;d do anything to help him any thing  And Agnes sobbed bitterly</p>
<p>I had never seen Agnes cry before It made me so sad that I could only say helplessly  My dear Agnes Please don&#x27;t cry  However in a few minutes she was calm again and I was able to leave her promising to visit her and her father in Canter bury very soon</p>
<p>6 David falls in love</p>
<p>A gnes had asked me to be polite to Uriah if I met him and so when I saw him the next day near the law courts I was careful not to offend him He looked even stranger than before with his small evil head and long thin body and his wide oily smile When we shook hands I no ticed how cold and wet his hand felt just like a fish</p>
<p>Would you would you like to come to my rooms for coffee Uriah  I offered trying to hide my horror of him</p>
<p>Oh Master Copperfield I mean Mister Copperfield I should say now How kind of you I&#x27;m too humble to expect such kindness But I would like that</p>
<p>And when we reached my flat he looked at me with an unpleasantly confident smile and said  Perhaps you&#x27;ve heard that I&#x27;m going to become Mr Wickfield&#x27;s partner Mr Cop perfield</p>
<p>Yes  I replied  Agnes has told me about it</p>
<p>Ah I&#x27;m glad to hear that Miss Agnes knows about it  he answered  Thank you for that Mr Copperfield</p>
<p>I was annoyed with myself for mentioning Agnes&#x27;s name and hated hearing him say it but I said nothing and drank my coffee</p>
<p>You said once Mr Copperfield  continued Uriah rubbing his hands together happily  that perhaps I&#x27;d be Mr Wickfield&#x27;s partner one day It was kind of you to say so A humble person like me remembers things like that And now it&#x27;s true I&#x27;m glad to think I&#x27;ve been able to help poor Mr Wickfield Oh how very careless he has been If I hadn&#x27;t been his assistant he would certainly have lost his business his house and all his money by now Of course I&#x27;m helping him because I admire him and not only him</p>
<p>Suddenly although the room was warm an icy coldness spread through my body as I stared into his cruel little face</p>
<p>Miss Agnes is looking beautiful at the moment isn&#x27;t she  he went on smiling horribly  Mr Copperfield I trust you because as you know I&#x27;ve always liked you although I&#x27;m so humble and you&#x27;re a gentleman So I&#x27;d like to tell you my little secret In spite of my low position I love Miss Agnes I&#x27;ve given my heart to her and I hope to marry her one day</p>
<p>There was a purple mist in front of my eyes I wanted to hit his ugly face or stab a knife right into his wicked heart I was almost mad with anger But I thought of Agnes&#x27;s request and I managed to control myself</p>
<p>Have have you spoken to Agnes about your your love  I asked as calmly as I could</p>
<p>Oh no Mr Copperfield I&#x27;m waiting for the right moment Perhaps I&#x27;ll ask her when I become her father&#x27;s partner She&#x27;ll think kindly of me you see when she realizes how much her father needs me She loves him so much Ah what a good daughter my Agnes is And what an excellent wife she&#x27;ll be to me</p>
<p>Dear sweet Agnes my adopted sister I did not know any man good enough to be her husband Could she ever marry this worthless insect When Uriah left my flat I spent a sleepless night worrying about what I should do In the end I decided to say nothing to Agnes about Uriah&#x27;s plan as she already had enough to worry about</p>
<p>A year had passed since I first started work in Mr Spenlow&#x27;s firm I often went to court with him and began to understand the details of some of the most difficult cases Mr Spenlow was kind to me and occasionally talked to me not only about law but also about other matters I discovered that his wife had died and that he lived in a large country house just outside London with his only daughter and her paid companion One day he invited me to his house for the weekend and I accepted gratefully So on Friday evening Mr Spenlow&#x27;s coach and horses drove us to the house</p>
<p>When I saw the Spenlows home I realized how rich Mr Spenlow must be It was a lovely old building with large gar dens As soon as we entered Mr Spenlow asked one of the servants  Where&#x27;s Miss Dora</p>
<p>Dora  I thought  What a beautiful name  We went in to the sitting room and I suppose Mr Spenlow introduced me I did not notice because nothing mattered at that moment I just stared stupidly at his daughter Dora lost in wonder at her beauty and unable to say anything I had fallen in love in a second</p>
<p>As I stared I heard a voice speaking to me  but it was not Dora&#x27;s It was her companion whom I had not noticed at all while Mr Spenlow was making the introductions When I saw that the companion was Miss Murdstone I was surprised certainly but nothing could take my attention away from Dora for more than a second or two</p>
<p>Mr Spenlow explained that Miss Murdstone had been kind enough to come and look after his poor motherless daughter and to be her confidential friend and companion But it seemed to me that Dora was neither friendly nor confidential towards her stern companion</p>
<p>As for me the rest of the weekend passed in a kind of fog We ate meals and went for walks People spoke to me and I answered But I have no idea what I actually said All I re member was Dora&#x27;s golden hair and Dora&#x27;s blushing face and Dora&#x27;s beautiful blue eyes Occasionally I was lucky enough to speak to her alone and then I was so shy that I blushed as much as Dora herself I was very jealous of the little dog that she carried everywhere with her Sometimes I thought she liked me a little and at other times I was sure she would never love me I was wildly desperately in love</p>
<p>I had wondered if Miss Murdstone would try and blacken my name with the Spenlows but on that first evening she had taken me to one side</p>
<p>David Copperfield   she said coldly  I see no need for either of us to speak about the past to anyone here I imagine we are agreed on that</p>
<p>Certainly ma am We are agreed on that although I shall never change my opinion of you</p>
<p>I put Miss Murdstone out of my mind and for several weeks after meeting Dora I lived in a dream I did my work automatically and I never stopped thinking of her The greatest happiness I could imagine was being engaged to Dora I dared not hope that one day we would be married</p>
<p>While walking round London one day hoping to meet Dora out shopping I met my old schoolfriend Tommy Traddles  He was living in the city like me and was also studying to become a lawyer I arranged to visit him and went to his house after work the next day He lived in one room in a rented house in a very poor part of the city His room was small and almost empty</p>
<p>Copperfield I&#x27;m glad to see you he said warmly  you can see I haven&#x27;t got much furniture but I&#x27;m hoping to earn more money later when I&#x27;ve finished my studies</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t you have a rich uncle Traddles  I asked</p>
<p>Yes but I&#x27;ve always been unlucky you know He decided he didn&#x27;t like me so he didn&#x27;t leave me anything when he died  I&#x27;m really very poor and I have to do several jobs to pay for my studies  Traddles looked surprisingly cheerful  But I must tell you Copperfield as you&#x27;re an old friend that I&#x27;m engaged To a lovely girl who comes from a large family and lives in Devon</p>
<p>I was thinking of Dora as I shook hands with him and congratulated him enthusiastically  Will you get married soon  I asked</p>
<p>No she&#x27;s very poor too so we&#x27;ll have to wait a long time until we&#x27;ve saved enough money She&#x27;s such a dear girl Copperfield She says she&#x27;ll wait for me until she&#x27;s sixty if necessary And I&#x27;m quite happy here with the people who rent the house the Micawbers are very kind</p>
<p>Who did you say  I cried  The Micawbers I know them</p>
<p>Just then Mr Micawber himself knocked at the door and entered His stomach was a little fatter and his face a little older than before but he looked as confident as ever I went up to him and shook his hand</p>
<p>How are you Mr Micawber  I asked  Do you remember me</p>
<p>Is it possible  Can it be  Have I the pleasure of seeing my old friend Copperfield again   he replied  a smile spreading over his large face He turned to call downstairs  My dear Come and meet this gentleman  my love</p>
<p>When Mrs Micawber came in she was also delighted to see me and we talked for some time about the twins  and the other children and her husband&#x27;s business interests But this conversation soon made Mr Micawber rather depressed</p>
<p>You see Copperfield  he said miserably  nothing has turned up yet Sometimes I wonder whether anything ever will turn up I can&#x27;t pay for our food or even our water It&#x27;s hard enough for me to accept the situation but how can I expect my dear wife to live like this Perhaps it would have been better if I had never asked her to marry me  He put his head in his hands</p>
<p>Micawber  cried his wife  How can you say that You know I have always loved and admired you and always will love and admire you My dear husband  And they fell into each other&#x27;s arms sobbing on each other&#x27;s shoulders In a few moments they had both dried their eyes and looked quite cheerful again I realized that the Micawbers had not changed at all but this quick change of mood was rather a surprise for Traddles</p>
<p>Before I left  I made sure I had a word in private with my old schoolfriend  Traddles  I whispered  take my advice don&#x27;t lend Mr Micawber any money He&#x27;s got a lot of debts</p>
<p>Traddles looked uncomfortable  Thank you Copperfield  he whispered in reply  but I&#x27;ve already lent him some I don&#x27;t know whether he&#x27;ll give it back you know how unlucky I am</p>
<p>When I got back to my rooms I found Steer forth waiting for me there I thought of Agnes&#x27;s warning about him but when I saw his open  good looking face I could not believe he could be a bad influence on anyone However there was something rather strange in his manner that night Sometimes he seemed quite depressed almost desperate  but a minute later he was laughing wildly and I had no idea why he was like that</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve just been to Yarmouth David  he told me</p>
<p>Oh  I replied  You&#x27;ve seen the Peggotty family I expect</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t seen much of them but I have got some news for you It&#x27;s about old Barkis I&#x27;m afraid his illness has got much worse and the doctor thinks he&#x27;ll die very soon</p>
<p>Oh dear  I said  Poor Peggotty will be so sad</p>
<p>Yes it&#x27;s bad luck  replied Steerforth carelessly  But people die in this world every minute I&#x27;m not afraid of death I want to live life in my own way and nobody can stop me  He threw his head back proudly I looked into his handsome face wondering why he was so excited which was unusual for him</p>
<p>Steerforth I think I&#x27;ll have to go to Yarmouth myself  I said  Perhaps I can help Peggotty at this difficult time</p>
<p>Smiling he put his hands on my shoulders  I wish I could be as good as you David promise me that if anything ever happens to separate us you&#x27;ll think of me at my best Promise me that</p>
<p>Steerforth you have no best or worst for me  I answered  You will always have your place in my heart</p>
<p>And as he turned to go he gave me his hand  and smiled in his old friendly way That is how I like to remember him now that I shall never touch his hand again or see him smile</p>
<p>When I arrived in Yarmouth I went straight to Barkis&#x27;s house In the sitting room I found Daniel Ham and Emily Ham was standing by the door while Emily was sobbing in Daniel&#x27;s arms None of them seemed surprised to see me</p>
<p>Emily&#x27;s very young Master David  explained Daniel  It&#x27;s hard for her to accept death That&#x27;s why she&#x27;s crying Now cheer up Emily my dear Ham has come to take you home what&#x27;s that  He bent his grey head down to hear her whispered reply  You want to stay here with your old uncle But you should go with Ham he&#x27;ll be your husband soon</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all right  said Ham  If it makes Emily happy it&#x27;ll make me happy  I&#x27;ll go home alone  He went over to Emily and gave her a gentle kiss She seemed to turn away from him a little As Ham went out I went upstairs to see poor Barkis</p>
<p>He was lying unconscious in bed looking very pale and ill Peggotty was sitting beside him She jumped up and took me delightedly in her arms just as she used to do Then she turned to her husband  Barkis my dear  she said almost cheerfully   here&#x27;s Master David who brought us together you remember He carried your messages for you  Can you speak to him</p>
<p>Barkis lay silently there not moving We sat beside him all through that long night In the early morning  he suddenly opened his eyes reached out his hand to me and said clearly With a pleasant smile  Barkis is willing  And then he closed his eyes and died</p>
<p>He was a good man  said Peggotty with tears in her eyes  I shall miss him</p>
<p>I was able to help Peggotty with the arrangements for the funeral Barkis was buried in Blunderstone churchyard close to my mother and little brother We discovered that Barkis had saved quite a lot of money which he left to Peggotty and Daniel So I knew that Peggotty would not need to work in future</p>
<p>On the day before the funeral we all arranged to meet at the old boat It was my last evening in Yarmouth as I was re turning to London the following day When I arrived I was surprised to see that Ham and Emily were not there Peggotty was feeling more cheerful now and Daniel was talking to her Just then Ham came to the door</p>
<p>Master David come outside a minute would you   he asked I stepped outside and Ham shut the door carefully It was raining heavily and as we stood on the lonely beach I noticed how very pale Ham&#x27;s face was</p>
<p>Ham  I cried  What&#x27;s the matter</p>
<p>Master David  he sobbed wildly I had never seen such a strong man cry like that before  It&#x27;s Emily I&#x27;d have died for her I love her with all my heart But she&#x27;s run away and worse than that Oh how I wish God had saved her from this ruin</p>
<p>I shall never fonget his desperate face turned towards me and the pain in his honest eyes</p>
<p>You&#x27;re educated Master David  he continued  You know how to express yourself Help me How can I ever ex plain to him in there He loves her even more than I do</p>
<p>I saw the door open and tried to stop Ham speaking but it was too late Daniel Peggotty came out and when he saw us he seemed to realize immediately what we were talking about The expression on his face changed in a moment and he pulled us both back inside I found myself with a letter in my hand which Ham had given me</p>
<p>Read it sir  said Daniek his face pale and trembling and his eyes wild  Read it slowly please</p>
<p>The room was completely silent as I read aloud</p>
<p>Dear Ham</p>
<p>Please  please  forgive me for running away and leaving you When you see this I&#x27;ll be far away I shall never return to my dear home unless he marries me and brings me back as a lady Oh I&#x27;m so sorry and so ashamed I know this will break your heart but believe me I&#x27;m not good enough for you I&#x27;m too wicked Tell Uncle I&#x27;ll always love him even if he can never love me again And I&#x27;ll always think of you dear Ham even if you hate me for what I&#x27;ve done Forgive me and goodbye</p>
<p>Emily</p>
<p>Daniel did not move for a long time after I had finished reading I took his hand but he did not notice Suddenly he appeared to wake up and said in a low voice</p>
<p>Who&#x27;s the man I want to know his name</p>
<p>Ham looked quickly at me and I felt a shock run through my whole body I fell on to a chair and could not speak</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t listen Master David  Ham said hesitating  we don&#x27;t blame you for it  Peggotty put her arm round my neck but I could not move  A gentleman&#x27;s been here very often recently  continued Ham in a broken voice  and to day people saw Emily driving off with him in his coach</p>
<p>Tell me  cried Daniel wildly  Is his name Steerforth</p>
<p>It is  replied Ham just as wildly  and I&#x27;m sorry Master David but he&#x27;s the wickedest man I&#x27;ve ever known</p>
<p>After a moment Daniel spoke He looked suddenly much older  I wish I&#x27;d drowned him when I had the chance But it&#x27;s too late now There&#x27;s no peace for me here while my dear girl is away I&#x27;m going to look for her and bring her back home Don&#x27;t any of you try to stop me Ham you must stay here in Yarmouth Keep a light always burning in the window of this house so that if the poor girl ever comes back she can find her way home across the sand I&#x27;m going to London and France and all over the world if necessary I&#x27;m prepared to spend my whole life travelling until I find her If anything happens to me if I don&#x27;t come back tell her I forgive her tell her my love for her is unchanged</p>
<p>And although we all tried hard to persuade him to stay he refused to listen He took his coat hat bag and stick and stepped out into the darkness We watched him walking along the London road until he disappeared from sight I often thought of that lonely figure in the next few weeks and months walking through strange streets in foreign cities looking for his adopted child When I thought of him I remembered his last words to us If anything happens to me if I don&#x27;t come back tell her forgive her tell her my love for her is unchanged</p>
<p>7 Good news and bad news for David</p>
<p>All this time I had gone on loving Dora more than ever</p>
<p>The more evil there seemed to be in the world the more brightly Dora&#x27;s star shone down on me I am sure I considered her a beautiful angel far above the rest of us poor humans and I had no real hope of persuading her to love me</p>
<p>Peggotty had come to London with me as she was feeling rather lonely after Barkis&#x27;s death and Daniel&#x27;s departure and I could not stop myself telling her all about Dora She was very interested and most encouraging</p>
<p>The young lady should be very proud to have such a hand some intelligent young man as you Master Davie  she cried  And I&#x27;m sure her father will be delighted to accept you as her husband  But I could not share her hopeful view of the sitution</p>
<p>However a wonderful thing happened During a long conversation with Mr Spenlow in the office he mentioned that it was Dora&#x27;s birthday the following week and invited me to a picnic to celebrate it As soon as I heard this I went completely mad and could not think at all clearly In the next week I bought expensive new clothes and boots and arranged to hire a handsome white horse On the day of the picnic  I got up at six in the morning and went to Govent Garden market to buy the freshest and most beautiful flowers for Dora and by ten o clock I was riding towards the Spenlows house</p>
<p>How lovely Dora looked in her sky blue dress and white hat when I met her in the garden in front of the house And when she accepted my flowers with delight I almost thought I would die of happiness</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll be glad to hear Mr Copperfield  she said smiling prettily  that cross Miss Murdstone isn&#x27;t here She&#x27;ll be away for at least three weeks Instead I have my dear friend Miss Julia Mills here with me</p>
<p>Sitting next to Dora was a young lady I had not noticed be fore Although she was only about twenty she looked very calm and wise I later discovered that she had had an unhappy experience in love and had decided never again to become personally involved in matters of the heart</p>
<p>How delightful for you  I answered blushing as I always did when I spoke to Dora  And everything that is delightful to you is delightful to me Miss Spenlow  Miss Mills said nothing but smiled kindly on us both</p>
<p>To get to the picnic place which was some way from the house Mr Spenlow Dora and Miss Mills drove in an open carriage while I rode by their side on my handsome white horse I shall never have such a ride again Dora sat with her back to the horses looking towards me and holding my flowers close to her sweet face Our eyes often met and I am surprised I did not fall off my horse I did not notice the dust or the road we were taking Sometimes Mr Spenlow spoke to me about the scenery and I replied politely but I cannot remember what I said All I could see was Dora</p>
<p>I was very disappointed when we arrived to find that other guests had been invited I wat quite jealous even of the ladies because they talked to Dora and took her away from me but I hated all the men as soon as I saw them There was a very unpleasant talkative man with a red moustache who insisted he knew all about preparing food and soon had most of the young ladies round him One of them was Dora I felt that he was now my worst enemy</p>
<p>When we started eating I saw to my horror that Red Moustache was sitting with a huge plate of chicken at Dora&#x27;s feet I could not think clearly but I pretended to be cheerful I sat with a young lady dressed in pink and talked amusingly to her and looked at her and fetched her whatever she needed Sometimes I looked over at Dora and she looked back at me but she had Red Moustache and I had the young lady in pink</p>
<p>After the meal the young lady&#x27;s mother took her away and I walked alone into a wood feeling angry and desperate I was just planning to ride away on my handsome white horse although I did not know where to when I saw Dora and Miss Mills coming to meet me</p>
<p>Mr Copperfield  said Miss Mills  You are unhappy</p>
<p>No no Miss Mills  I protested firmly  Perfectly happy</p>
<p>And Dora  continued Miss Mills  you are unhappy</p>
<p>Oh good heavens no Julia  cried Dora  Not at all</p>
<p>Mr Copperfield and Dora  said Miss Mills looking old and wise  enough of this foolishness You love each other Confess it and be happy Take the chance that life offers you Listen to one who speaks from bitter experience</p>
<p>I was so hot and excited that I took Dora&#x27;s little hand immediately and kissed it and she let me I kissed Miss Mills&#x27;s hand too and life seemed wonderful again</p>
<p>Dora shyly put her arm in mine and we walked about together until much too soon we heard the other guests calling her name So we had to go back and when they wanted Dora to sing a song Red Moustache offered to fetch the guitar from the carriage for her But Dora told him nobody except me knew where it was</p>
<p>So I fetched the guitar and I held her gloves and I sat beside her while she sang And I knew that in that great crowd of people she was singing only for me who loved her</p>
<p>When the guests left I rode beside the carriage all the way back to the Spenlows house Mr Spenlow who had drunk a lot of wine was asleep in his seat and Miss Mills was smiling in a motherly way as Dora and I whispered happily to each other Once Miss Mills called me to her side of the carriage</p>
<p>Dora is coming to stay with me  she told me quietly   the day after tomorrow Perhaps you would like to visit us</p>
<p>Miss Mills How can I ever thank you  I said  What a friend you are to Miss Spenlow and me</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Spenlows  house I had to say goodbye to Dora and ride back to London On the way I remembered everything she had done or said ten thousand times I decided I had to tell her I loved her as soon as possible and ask whether she loved me too It was the most important question in the world and only Dora could give me the answer to it</p>
<p>So two days later I dressed in my finest clothes and went to the address Miss Mills had given me The servant took me to the sittingroom where I found Julia Mills learning a song and Dora painting the flowers I had given her After a short conversation Miss Mills made an excuse and left the room and Dora and I were alone together</p>
<p>I hope your poor horse wasn&#x27;t tired the other night  said Dora raising her beautiful eyes to mine  It was a long way for him to and from the picnic place</p>
<p>I must ask her today I thought My whole body was trembling  It was a long way for him  I answered  For me it seemed very short because of my happiness in being so near you</p>
<p>There was a moment&#x27;s silence Then Dora said  You didn&#x27;t seem to care for that happiness earlier in the day when you were sitting with the lady in pink But I expect you don&#x27;t mean what you say And of course you&#x27;re quite free to do whatever you like</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know how I did it It happened so quickly Suddenly I had Dora in my arms and I couldn&#x27;t stop speaking I told her how I loved her I told her I would die without her And when she blushed and cried a little I said I had loved her day and night since the moment I had first seen her I told her that nobody had ever loved or could ever love as much as I loved her</p>
<p>Somehow I found myself sitting quietly next to Dora on the sofa holding her little hand We were engaged I suppose we realized that one day we would get married but for the moment we were going to keep our engagement secret from Mr Spenlow When Miss Mills came in she was delighted to hear our news and promised to help us as much as possible</p>
<p>Now began one of the happiest times of my life When I look back I see how foolish I was but how loving and sincere I visited Dora every day and I did not have time for anyone or anything else But in the middle of my excitement I suddenly thought of Agnes of her clear calm eyes and her gentle face and I sat down immediately to write to her and tell her all about Dora I knew that as my adopted sister she would share my happiness and I wanted her approval</p>
<p>One day when Peggotty and I were having tea in my flat Tommy Traddles came to visit me  My dear Copperfield  he cried  I&#x27;ve been several times before but you&#x27;ve been out</p>
<p>My dear Traddles  I replied  yes I&#x27;m very sorry  I&#x27;ve been visiting my Miss D you know</p>
<p>I expect she lives in London doesn&#x27;t she Mine that&#x27;s Sopby beautiful name isn&#x27;t it Mine lives in Devon I think I told you So I don&#x27;t see her very often She really is the dearest girl She&#x27;s very busy at home you know looking after the other nine children And her mother who&#x27;s unable to walk</p>
<p>What a wonderful girl she must be  I agreed politely  And tell me Traddles how is Mr Micawber</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not living in his house at the moment  said Traddles  because his creditors demanded payment of his debts recently and he had to move to another house To avoid these unpleasant men he&#x27;s even changed his name to Mortimer and he only comes out of the house after dark wearing glasses</p>
<p>So nothing has turned up for him yet And what abut the money you lent him Traddles</p>
<p>I&#x27;m afraid I may not get it back But Mr Micawber promises to give it back one day He&#x27;s a fine honest man isn&#x27;t he  And Traddles looked hopefully at me</p>
<p>Before I could reply we heard footsteps on the stairs I was very surprised to see my aunt coming upstairs She was carrying two cases and her cat and was followed closely by Mr Dick carrying two more cases</p>
<p>My dear aunt  I cried  What an unexpected pleasure  We kissed each other and I shook hands with Mr Dick Traddles left quietly as he could see we would be discussing family matters Peggotty made some more tea for my aunt who had sat down heavily on her cases</p>
<p>Dear aunt  I said  Make yourself more comfortable Sit in an armchair or sit on the sofa</p>
<p>Why do you think I&#x27;m sitting on my cases she asked looking seriously at me</p>
<p>I shook my head unable to guess</p>
<p>Because what I&#x27;m sitting on is all I have Because I&#x27;ve lost all my money my dear</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t have been more shocked if the house and all of us in it had fallen into the River Thames</p>
<p>Yes  continued my aunt putting her head calmly on my shoulder  I&#x27;ll tell you all about it tomorrow David but tonight we must find a bed for Mr Dick and I&#x27;ll sleep here to save money  So that night my aunt agreed to take my bed while I planned to sleep on the sitting-room sofa and I took Mr Dick to a neighbour&#x27;s house to rent a room When I returned I found my aunt walking up and down in front of the sitting-room fire</p>
<p>That Peggotty woman is very fond of you David   she said   She&#x27;s been offering to give us some of her money the money she inherited from her husband Of course I refused at once But she&#x27;s a good woman And she&#x27;s been telling me about the trouble at Yarmouth</p>
<p>Yes poor Emily  I could not stop myself saying</p>
<p>Silly Emily you mean But I&#x27;m sorry for you because you cared for her once And now Peggotty tells me you&#x27;re in love again</p>
<p>I blushed  I love Dora with all my heart aunt</p>
<p>I suppose the little thing is very lovely is she</p>
<p>No one can imagine how lovely she is</p>
<p>She isn&#x27;t at all silly is she  asked my aunt</p>
<p>I had never considered this possibility before and could only repeat what my aunt had said  Silly  aunt</p>
<p>Well well I only ask  replied my aunt gently  David you&#x27;re very loving like your poor mother and you need a good serious sensible person to love</p>
<p>Aunt if you only knew how sensible Dora is  I replied</p>
<p>Oh David  she answered  Blind blind blind</p>
<p>This made me feel a little uncomfortable but I was glad she knew my secret I thought perhaps she was rather tiredt so I said goodnight She went to my bedroom and I lay down on the sofa</p>
<p>How miserable I was that night I knew I should be thinking of my poor aunt&#x27;s situation but I could not prevent myself from thinking of Dora How could I marry her if I had no money no expensive clothes to wear no handsome white horse to ride or flowers to give her</p>
<p>The next morning I got up early to have a walk in the fresh air and on the way home a carriage stopped beside me and Agnes Wickfield got out I immediately felt better when I saw her beautiful calm face smiling at me She had heard that my aunt was in trouble and had come to London to see her We walked together to my flat</p>
<p>You know that Uriah Heep is my father&#x27;s partner now &#x27;she said quietly  His influence over my father is far too great Father is much much worse He looks years older and I&#x27;m afraid that encouraged by Uriah he drinks more than ever Uriah and his old mother live with us now so I can&#x27;t always be with Father to to protect him from whatever Uriah is planning I just hope that love and truth will always be stronger than evil</p>
<p>I could not give her my opinion of Uriah because by then we had arrived at the flat My aunt was very pleased to see Agnes again and made us sit down on the sofa next to Peggotty</p>
<p>Now let me explain to you all what happened to my money  said my aunt firmly I was surprised to see that Agnes was pale and trembling Betsey Trotwood continued  I saved a lot of money over the years and my lawyer Mr Wickfield used to help me invest it in the right companies But recently I thought he wasn&#x27;t such a good lawyer as he used to be so I decided to invest my money myself What a lot of mistakes I made Who knows where it&#x27;s gone In gold and foreign banks and so on It&#x27;s no good worrying about it but I can tell you there&#x27;s nothing left</p>
<p>The colour was beginning to return to Agnes&#x27;s face  So it it wasn&#x27;t my father&#x27;s fault dear Miss Trotwood</p>
<p>Not at all Agnes  said my aunt cheerfully  Now can any of you give me some advice I&#x27;ve asked my servant Janet to rent my little house in Kent That will bring in about seventy pounds a year I think we&#x27;ll need more than that to live on</p>
<p>You and David could share this flat very cheaply with Mr Dick just round the corner in his rented room  suggested Agnes  And I think I can find a little job for David Do you remember Dr Strong the headmaster of the Canterbury school Now that he&#x27;s retired and come to live in London he needs a private secretary to work for him in the mornings and evenings at his house He was asking Father about it the other day What do you think</p>
<p>Agnes I cried  What would we do without you  You are my good angel I told you so before I could easily be Dr Strong&#x27;s secretary as well as continuing my work in Mr Spenlow&#x27;s firm I&#x27;ll go and see him today and arrange it with him</p>
<p>Agnes gave me her beautiful smile as she got up to leave I went downstairs with her and as we walked together to the coach station I saw an old beggar with a white stick in the street He was holding out his thin hand for money and crying  Blind Blind Blind  It sounded like an echo of what my aunt had said the day before Oh Agnes dear sister If I had only known then what I discovered long afterwards</p>
<p>8 David&#x27;s new life</p>
<p>With Agnes&#x27;s encouragement I felt much stronger and no longer depressed My life now bad a purpose I intended to work as hard as I could to help my aunt and to earn enough money to marry Dora I got up every morning at five o clock walked to Dr Strong&#x27;s house on the other side of London worked with him for two hours every morning and then walked back to Mr Spenlow&#x27;s office where I spent most of the day in the lawcourts Then I returned to Dr Strong&#x27;s for two or three more hours in the evening and finally came home to my flat where my aunt Peggotty and Mr Dick would be waiting for me I was glad to be able to tell my aunt that Dr Strong would pay me seventy pounds a year for my work With that and the rent from my aunt&#x27;s house in Kent we could live quite well if we were careful Because I was young and healthy I did not mind hard work and whenever I was tired I told myself  You&#x27;re doing it for Dora  and that made me work even harder</p>
<p>When I met Traddles one day near the courts I told him about my new situation and he was very sympathetic</p>
<p>But I have news for you too Copperfield  he said  The Micawbers are moving to Canterbury</p>
<p>Oh That means something must have turned up for them  I replied interested</p>
<p>Yes Mr Micawber is going to become assistant to someone called Uriah Heep a partner in a firm of Canterbury lawyers</p>
<p>Heep  I cried in horror  I know him Why would Mr Micawber want to work for him</p>
<p>Well I do know that Heep has paid all Mr Micawber&#x27;s debts in London  answered Traddles  The whole family is leaving tomorrow They asked me to tell you</p>
<p>I wondered why Heep wanted Micawber to work for him and I felt sure Uriah had some evil plan in his ugly head</p>
<p>The next day Peggotty was returning to Yarmouth to look after Ham while Daniel was away After I had taken her to the coach station and said goodbye to her I hurried to Miss Mills&#x27;s house I had not yet told Dora about the changes in my life because I had not wanted to explain it all in a letter but today she was visiting Julia Mills and was expecting me to come to tea</p>
<p>How happy and heautiful Dora looked when she met me in the sitting-room And how shocked and miserable she looked when I asked her immediately  Can you love a beggar Dora  My pretty little Dora She had no idea what I meant</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be silly David  she cried  What are you talking about</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true Dora my love  I cried  I&#x27;ve lost all my money I&#x27;m a beggar  And I looked so serious that Dora was frightened and began to sob bitterly on my shoulder</p>
<p>But I love you Dora and always will  I continued  It doesn&#x27;t matter if we are poor because I&#x27;ll work hard to buy our bread We don&#x27;t need much as long as we have each other Tell me your heart is still mine dear Dora</p>
<p>Oh yes  she cried  Oh yes it&#x27;s all yours Only don&#x27;t frighten me again Don&#x27;t talk of hard work and bread I don&#x27;t understand I hardly ever eat bread</p>
<p>I loved her more than ever But I felt she was not very practical In a few moments when she had stopped crying and was calmer I tried again to make her understand</p>
<p>My dearest May I mention something</p>
<p>Oh please don&#x27;t be practical begged Dora tears coming to her lovely eyes  It frightens me so much</p>
<p>My dear one if we work together and share our problems it will make us and our love stronger</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m not strong at all  she cried miserably  Ask Julia She&#x27;ll tell you I&#x27;m weak and foolish</p>
<p>But if you thought sometimes my sweet Dora that you are engaged to a poor man if you tried to see how your father manages the servants or how much food costs in the markets it would be helpful to us We must be brave dear Dora Our path in life is steep and rocky</p>
<p>I was becoming quite enthusiastic but I suddenly realized I had said far too much Poor little Dora was sobbing and screaming with fear and in a moment was lying unconscious on the sofa I really thought I had killed her I threw water on her face and went down on my knees to ask her to forgive me I called myself a selfish heartless creature and shouted for Julia Mills At last she hurried in and I explained what had happened When Dora opened her eyes her friend helped her upstairs</p>
<p>While Dora was upstairs washing her face and calming herself I asked Miss Mills&#x27;s advice on the best way to encourage Dora to become more practical Miss Mills shook her head sadly</p>
<p>I must be honest with you Mr Copperfield Our dearest Dora is a beautiful innocent child of nature full of light and happiness She is above the things of this world which we poor humans have to worry about I think you&#x27;ll just have to accept that fact</p>
<p>When Dora came downstairs again she looked so lovely that I felt bitterly angry with myself for making her unhappy  even for a moment We had tea and she sang her French songs to me and played the guitar We were happy again until the moment when I stupidly mentioned that I had to get up at five o clock the next morning Suddenly her pretty face looked sad and she did not play or sing again When I got up to go she came up close to me and said lovingly  You bad boy don&#x27;t be so silly Don&#x27;t get up at five o clock Why should you</p>
<p>But my love I have work to do I have to work in order to live   I replied    Work Don&#x27;t be so foolish  David dear  and she seemed to think that was the end of the matter  as she gave me a kiss straight from her innocent little heart</p>
<p>I loved her  and went on loving her  But I went on working hard too  and worrying about earning money  Some evenings as I sat opposite my aunt in my little sitting-room at the end of another exhausting day  I was quite frightened  when I thought of the problems I was going to have to solve alone</p>
<p>Several months passed in this way  Dora and I wrote to each other every day  and occasionally I was able to visit her at Miss Mills&#x27;s house  But one morning when I arrived at the office for work  Mr Spenlow greeted me very coldly and asked me to step into his office  where we could talk privately When I entered the room I was surprised to see Miss Murd-stone standing by his desk  staring unpleasantly at me  I knew at once that Dora&#x27;s father had discoversd our secret  and I guessed who had told him</p>
<p>Mr Copperfield   said Mr Spenlow  frowning sternly at me   I am sorry to say that Miss Murdstone has found some letters which appear to be from you to my daughter Dora  Are they yours</p>
<p>I looked at the letters he handed to me  blushed  and whispered   Yes  sir   Poor little Dora I hoped she had not been frightened by that horrible Murdstone woman  I hated to think Of Dora&#x27;s unhappiness at losing my letters</p>
<p>I suspected something was wrong when Miss Spenlow came back from her last visit to Miss Mills   said Miss Murd-stone  looking very pleased with herself   I always said Julia Mills was not a suitable friend for Miss Spenlow  and I was right</p>
<p>Mr Spenlow appeared to agree  but rather sadly</p>
<p>I am very sorry  sir   I said   but it is all my fault  Please don&#x27;t blame Dora</p>
<p>Miss Spenlow to you  young man   said her father angrily.</p>
<p>I know it wasn&#x27;t right to keep it secret  sir  but I love your daughter and I hope that one day</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t speak to me of love  Mr Copperfield  cried Mr Spenlow   You are both much too young  We&#x27;ll throw these letters in the fire  and you must promise to forget the whole thing  There is no question of your marrying Dora</p>
<p>But sir I can&#x27;t forget her I love her   I protested</p>
<p>That is my last word  M Copperfield  When you have time to consider  you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s wiser to do as I say  Now go to your work</p>
<p>I spent all day thinking of poor sweet Dora  and how she must be feeling  In the evening I hurried round to Miss Mills&#x27;s house  but although she spoke wisely of love and broken hearts  she could not offer me any practical advice.</p>
<p>The next day  after a sleepless night  I arrived at the office at the normal time  and discovered all the clerks standing talking at the front door  This was so unusual that I stopped to ask what had happened.</p>
<p>Why don&#x27;t you know   asked one of them  The police have found Mr Spenlow dead  I fell back  shocked</p>
<p>You look very pale  Mr Copperfield   said another  Sit down here  sir</p>
<p>Tell me  tell me what happened  I gasped</p>
<p>Well  he went into town to dinner last night  and the carriage and horses came back at midnight without him. He was driving himself  you see  So the servants went to look for him  and found him dead in the road  He must have been ill and have fallen out of the carriage  Anyway  he was dead when they found him.</p>
<p>This was a terrible shock to me  Perhaps his anger with me had made him ill.In that case I was partly to blame for his death  But I am sorry to say I was also jealous of Dora&#x27;s sadness  White she was crying for her dead father  she was not thinking of me  and I selfishly wanted to be the only person in her life</p>
<p>In the next few weeks I became quite desperate because I could not see or speak to my sweet Dora  Miss Mills reported that Dora cried all day  and when my name was mentioned only sobbed more loudly and said  Oh poor dear Father How wicked of me to keep a secret from him  Oh  Oh   So I did not feel encouraged to visit her  Soon after her father&#x27;s funeral  Dora was taken to live with her two aunts at Putney in south London  where she seemed to be further away from me than ever.</p>
<p>My aunt  meanwhile  began to be seriously worried about my health  as I was getting more and more depressed  So she suggested I should go to Dover for a few days  to make sure that her house was still in good condition  and then to Canter-bury  to visit the Wickfields  I agreed willingly  as I was always happy to see Agnes  It was easy to take a few day&#x27;s hoilday from my work at the lawcourts and with Dr Strong</p>
<p>I was glad to find that the person who was renting my aunt&#x27;s house in Dover was looking after it well  I was then free to continue my journey to Canterbury  that beautiful ancient city  which seemed very little changed since my schooldays  The soft  clean air made me feel better than I had done for weeks</p>
<p>When I arrived at the Wickfields House  I found Mr Micawber in Uriah Heep&#x27;s old office. We were pleased to see each other  but we both felt a little embarrassed. I realized that he did not want to talk about confidential matters concerning the firm of Heep and Wickfield  and he knew that I disliked his employer  Heep  So conversation was difficult and in the end I was glad to leave him  and go upstairs to look  for Agnes.</p>
<p>I found her in her sitting-room  and she looked up at me with such a warm welcome in her smile that I was very moved</p>
<p>Ah  Agnes   I sald   I&#x27;ve missed you so much recently You helped me such a lot in the old days that I suppose I never learnt to think for myself  I always feel I need your help and advice  I get into such trouble  and I get so worried  and have so little confidence in myself  but when I&#x27;m with you  you give me purpose  You make me strong  What is your secret my dear adopted sister</p>
<p>Agnes gave me her hand  which I kissed  and she went on in her sisterly way  to listen sympathetically as I told her everything that had happened in the past few weeks  As usual she knew the right thing to do She advised me to write to Dora&#x27;s aunts  to ask if I could visit Dora occasionally  and she encouraged me in my hopes of marriage  I felt again that peace which Agnes always brought to me</p>
<p>We had not been sitting together long when Mrs Heep came in She did not leave us for a moment all that evening  and I wondered whether Uriah had told her to watch over us Whenever I looked at Agnes&#x27;s lovely face  I saw Mrs Heep&#x27;s evil black eyes staring at me</p>
<p>The next day  Mrs Heep did not leave Agnes and me alone even for a minute  The Heeps  mother and son  seemed to me like two ugly great black birds hanging over the house  and they made me so uncomfortable that I went out for a walk in the afternoon  I was walking along a path near the house wondering if I should warn Agnes about Uriah&#x27;s plan of marriage when I heard footsteps behind me and turned to see Uriah himself running after me</p>
<p>Wait for me  Mr Copperfield   he cried</p>
<p>Actually   I said  I came out to be alone</p>
<p>Ah   he said  with his oily smile   you don&#x27;t like my mother being there all the time  do you</p>
<p>No I don&#x27;t  I replied not caring if I sounded rude.</p>
<p>But you see   he continued   in my humble position I have to be very careful  I&#x27;m not married to my Agnes yet and you&#x27;re a dangerous rival  Mr Copperfield</p>
<p>What  I cried in disgust   You allow Miss Wickfield no peace in her own home because of me Don&#x27;t you realize I think of her as my very dear sister  nothing more  Let me tell you I am engaged to another lady  There  Is that enough for you</p>
<p>Oh Mr Copperfield   cried Uriah  gratefully shaking my hand with his cold fishy one   I&#x27;ll tell Mother to stop watching you at once  Why didn&#x27;t you tell me that before  I know you&#x27;ve never liked and trusted me as I&#x27;ve liked you</p>
<p>We returned to the house together in silence  That evening after dinner  when Agnes and Mrs Heep had left us  Uriah said to Mr Wickfield  Let&#x27;s have some wine  partner and drink to young Mr Copperfield&#x27;s health  It isn&#x27;t often we have the pleasure of his company  is it  partner</p>
<p>I knew Uriah was deliberately encouraging Mr Wickfield to drink too much  but I saw that although Agnes&#x27;s father was aware of his weakness  he could no longer stop himself  As the evening passed  I was disgusted to see that Uriah became more and more cheerful as Mr Wickfield became more and more drunk  Finally Uriah stood up with a glass in his hand</p>
<p>Come  partner   he said with his evil smile  Let&#x27;s drink to the health of the most beautiful woman in the world</p>
<p>Poor  broken Mr wickfield looked for a moment at the picture of his dead wife on the wall  so similar to Agnes</p>
<p>I may be humble   continued Uriah  but I admire  no  I love your daughter Agnes</p>
<p>Suddenly a horrible cry came from Mr Wickfield He had stood up  and was screaming with anger  He behaved so wildly and desperately that I thought he had gone mad   My child and you  Heep  No  never  You&#x27;ve taken everything from me   my business  my good name  my home  but you&#x27;ll never take her</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#x27;ve said too much too soon   said Uriah  looking uncomfortable  But you&#x27;ll be sorry  partner  if you say any more  You need me  remember  You&#x27;ve got nothing without me  Remember that before you accuse me of anything</p>
<p>Just then the door opened and Agnes entered silently</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not well  Father  come with me   she whispered gently  and helped the ashamed old man out  I thought she must have heard what had been said</p>
<p>Later that night she came to say goodnight to me in the sitting-room  where I was alone  reading</p>
<p>Agnes  my dear sister   I said to her   promise me that you will never agree to marry that evil creature  for any reason</p>
<p>Through her tears she smiled calmly at me   Don&#x27;t worry brother I&#x27;m not afraid of him  My duty is to take care of Father  and I trust in God for the rest  Goodnight  David</p>
<p>9 David gets married</p>
<p>When I returned to London  I was delighted to discover that Dora&#x27;s aunts had decided to allow me to visit her  So every Saturday and Sunday I walked to their house in Putney  and spent the afternoons there  Sometimes Dora sang or played the guitar  sometimes we walked by the river  and sometimes I brought Traddles or my aunt with me  What happy times they were</p>
<p>Mr Spenlow had seemed a very rich man to me  but when he died the lawyers discovered that Dora would not inherit  much from him after all  as there were many debts to pay  So I did not feel worried that anyone would suspect me of marrying Dora for her money  Mr Spenlow&#x27;s firm lost a lot of business after his death  and I realized I would have to find another profession  I had always been good at writing  so I continued as secretary to Dr Strong  and also began reporting what was said in parliament  for the daily newspapers  I even wrote some stories  which were published in magazines  and was very pleased with the money I was earning</p>
<p>The months passed  and I reached my twenty-first  birthday  Traddles was still studying to be a lawyer  and still hoping to marry  the dearest girl in the world   I had moved out of my flat into a pleasant little house  and at last Dora&#x27;s aunts had agreed to our marriage  I was looking forward to the happiest day of my life  The next few days went by very fast in a mist of excitement and happiness  My aunt and Mr Dick moved into an even smaller house near mine  and Peggotty travelled from Yarmouth to be present at my wedding</p>
<p>I had always wanted Agnes to meet Dora  so I was glad when they met  the day before the wedding . It was beautiful to see Dora&#x27;s pretty face next to Agnes&#x27;s calm one  and Dora whispering her secrets into Agnes&#x27;s ears as a child does to its mother  But after Agnes had gone to see my aunt  Dora said seriously to me  when we were alone   Perhaps if I&#x27;d had Agnes as a friend when I was younger  David dear  I wouldn&#x27;t be so foolish and silly.</p>
<p>But I love you as you are  Dora   I replied.</p>
<p>I wonder why you ever fell in love with me</p>
<p>Because nobody can see you  and not fall in love with you</p>
<p>But if you&#x27;d never seen me  David  I wonder who you&#x27;d have married</p>
<p>I laughed and kissed her pretty lips  and she was soon as cheerful as usual again.</p>
<p>I cannot remember much about the wedding  except Dora by my side  in her beautiful dress and with a blushing face .Only when we were driving away from Putney together  did I wake from the dream  I believed it at last  It was my dear little wife I was sitting next to  whom I loved so much</p>
<p>It seemed strange to return from our week&#x27;s holiday and to find myself in my own small house with Dora  It was difficult to believe that we were going to spend the rest of our lives together  But soon I realized that married life was not as comfortable as it appeared  Neither Dora nor I knew anything about managing the house  We had a servant  of course  who managed us  She served our meals late  drank all our wine and stole all our silver spoons  When she finally left  we had another who behaved in a similar way  I felt I had to speak to Dora about it</p>
<p>My love   I began   couldn&#x27;t you perhaps control the servants a little better</p>
<p>David  don&#x27;t be cross with your little Dora   she said coming to sit on my knee  But I wanted to show I could be firm</p>
<p>My sweet Dora  I really do think you should do something  I mean  yesterday I had no supper at all because the beef was burnt  and last week  when Traddles came to dinner  the meat wasn&#x27;t cooked at all</p>
<p>You knew before you married me what a silly girl I am You shouldn&#x27;t have married me if you were going to be angry with me I don&#x27;t think you love me at all   And large tears ran down her pretty little face</p>
<p>Dora my love  Of course I love you Don&#x27;t cry   I could not continue our conversation then  But when she was calmer and had dried her tears  she said very seriously   David  will you do something for me  Will you call me your child-wife</p>
<p>Whatever do you mean  my dearest   I asked in surprise</p>
<p>Just that  whenever you feel I&#x27;m being very foolish  you should remember that I&#x27;m like a child  not as clever as you  or anyone else Don&#x27;t be disappointed with me  just remember that your child-wife loves you very  very much</p>
<p>Of all the conversations we had  I remember that one very clearly  It made a strong impression on me  and I am glad now that I did not try to change Dora any more  I had fallen in love with an innocent child-like girl and I could not expect her to become a wise  experienced woman in such a short time  But this meant that I had to carry all Our problems on my own shoulders  and sometimes I felt sorry that I did not have a real partner in life  with whom to share these worries</p>
<p>At about this time  my first book was published  and was a great success  Dora and my aunt were equally proud of me  I was becoming  however  rather worried about Dora  She had been ill for some time  and did not seem to be getting better She was not strong  and could not walk anywhere by herself I began to carry her downstairs every morning  and upstairs every night  and my aunt came every day to look after her My little wife was still very pretty  and cheerful  but I knew how light she was  and how weak  I began to fear she would not be with me for much longer</p>
<p>Early one morning when I was walking in the garden  I saw Danie I Peggotty opening the gate and coming towards me  His clothes were dusty  and he looked older than before  with white hair escaping untidily from under his hat  But his face was brown  and he looked healthy and strong</p>
<p>Master David   he said gladly when he saw me  I&#x27;ve come to tell you you were always our friend I&#x27;ve found her</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve found little Emily   I cried delightedly   But where  and how</p>
<p>I heard she&#x27;d travelled with that wicked Steerforth to Italy  and lived there for a while  But in the end he became tired of her  and left her She didn&#x27;t know what to do  or where to go  poor thing  But she came back to London  And that  s where I found my dear child  Because I&#x27;ve been all over Europe looking for her  but I knew she&#x27;d come back to England one day So every night I&#x27;ve been searching the city streets for her  And last night I found her  hopeless and exhausted  on a bridge looking down into the river  If I hadn  t found her then I don&#x27;t like to think what she would have done  But God was looking after my dear girl  and she&#x27;s safe with me now   He passed his strong hand over his eyes  and smiled at me   I&#x27;ve planned what we&#x27;ll do  Master David and I want to tell you about it  Emily and I are going to Australia It&#x27;s a new country  where nobody knows anything about her past We&#x27;ll be able to start a new life together We&#x27;ll be leaving in about six weeks</p>
<p>Very sensible  I said   And what about the rest of your family Are Ham and Peggotty going to Australia too</p>
<p>No  they aren&#x27;t Poor Ham will never be the same again I really think his heart is broken But he&#x27;s got a good job  and is very popular in Yarmouth so he&#x27;ll stay there  My sister wants to stay too partly because of you  Master David  and partly to look after Ham She cooks and cleans for him in Yarmouth  you know</p>
<p>Well my friend  I said shaking hands firmly with the old boatman   I wish you and Emily all the best in your new life</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll do my duty  whether I&#x27;m in England or Australia  said Daniel   And I&#x27;ll never be separated from my little Emily again</p>
<p>10 Death and discovery</p>
<p>Traddles and I had both received rather strange letters from Mr Micawber  in which he asked us to come to Canterbury  with my aunt  At this meeting  he said  he would show to all of us the proof of Uriah Heep&#x27;s wickedness Dora was too ill to come with us  so Traddles  my aunt  Mr Dick and I travelled to Canterbury by coach  spent the night in a hotel there and arrived punctually at the Wickfields house the next morning  Mr Micawber met us at the door and showed us into Uriah Heep&#x27;s office  Uriah himself seemed rather surprised to see us  but pretended to welcome us as old friends  Mr Micawber brought Agnes into the room too  and then stood firmly by the door</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t wait  Micawber   said Uriah to his assistant</p>
<p>But Mr Micawber did not move He stared coldly at his employer.</p>
<p>Did you hear what I said  Micawber   said Uriah angrily his little eyes becoming redder while his long face went very pale</p>
<p>Yes   replied Micawber   But I don&#x27;t choose to leave Listen to me  Heep  I don&#x27;t care if I lose my job I don&#x27;t wish to work any longer for the wickedest man in England</p>
<p>Uriah fell back  shocked  Looking slowly round at us  with a dark  evil expression on his face  he said   I see You&#x27;ve all arranged this between you  But I know who to blame for this It&#x27;s you Copperfield  You&#x27;re jealous of my new position  aren&#x27;t you But I know things about all of you which I can use against you for example I know about your father&#x27;s business mistakes  Miss Agnes  and I know about your past in the warehouse Copperfield So be careful I warn you all</p>
<p>Mr Micawber   I said calmly  please tell us what you were going to say about this man</p>
<p>Just then Traddles  who had disappeared a few minutes before reappeared with Mrs Heep Uriah had not noticed Traddles before   Who are you   he demanded angrily</p>
<p>I am a lawyer and a friend of Mr Wickfield  sir   said Traddles  in a businesslike way   And he&#x27;s asked me to carry out all his business arrangements from now on  This came as a surprise to me as well as to Uriah</p>
<p>The old fool has been drinking too much again   said Uriah looking uglier than ever   You can&#x27;t believe anything he says And you&#x27;ve bribed my assistant I suppose to speak against me</p>
<p>It&#x27;s you who have been dishonest   said Traddles firmly  as we shall hear from Mr Micawber  And we all looked expectantly towards that large  important-looking gentleman He was clearly delighted to have such an interested audience and cleared his throat several times before starting to speak As he spoke  his voice became louder and louder with excitement  until he was almost shouting</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen  he began   when very poor and desperate for work  I came to Canterbury as assistant to this evil man Heep I am sorry to say I was soon involved in all his wicked plans I may be poor  but I can&#x27;t accept his lies  his cheating  his bribes and all the rest of it  And so I&#x27;ve brought you here today  ladies and gentlemen  to hear me accuse Heep publicly  One  he has confused and lied to his partner so often that poor Mr Wickfield now thinks he has himself been dishonest Two  he has sometimes copied Mr Wickfield&#x27;s signature on to false documents and cheques  Three  for years he has been stealing large amounts of money from Mr Wickfield and the firm</p>
<p>You can never prove it   cried Uriah wildly</p>
<p>I have taken copies of all the necessary documents  said Mr Micawber confidently   while working as your clerk  And just to make sure  I&#x27;ve given them to Mr Traddles to keep safely</p>
<p>Uriah my dear boy  cried his mother sobbing bitterly   tell them how humble you are Say you didn&#x27;t mean to hurt anyone  Say you&#x27;re sorry and arrange matters with these gentlemen Do dear boy</p>
<p>Mother  be quiet  he whispered angrily   Don&#x27;t help my enemies Copperfield here would have given you a hundred pounds to say what you&#x27;ve just said</p>
<p>Suddenly my aunt attacked Uriah  hitting his head with her umbrella   Give me back my investments   she cried   I thought Mr Wickfield had lost my money  and I didn&#x27;t want to hurt Agnes by saying so  But now I know you&#x27;ve had control of the firm and you&#x27;ve stolen my money  Somehow I managed to get her away from him before she hurt him too badly</p>
<p>Then Mrs Heep fell on her knees to all of us  begging us to forgive her dear boy  and to remember how humble he always was</p>
<p>Be silent Mother   said her son  He turned to Traddles and asked unpleasantly   Well  What are you asking me to do</p>
<p>Not asking  demanding  Heep  You will give us the keys to all your boxes and drawers  all your documents and cheque-books  everything in fact that belongs to the firm  You will stay in this house until we&#x27;ve checked all the documents</p>
<p>And if I don&#x27;t agree   he asked  frowning</p>
<p>Copperfield  perhaps you would fetch a couple of policemen  Things move slowly in the lawcourts  but in the end Mr Wickfield will get his business back  and you  Heep will be in prison for a very long time</p>
<p>Uriah realized that he had to do what we wanted  and went to fetch the documents  with Mr Dick at his side  At the door  with his blackest  most evil expression  Heep turned and said to me   I&#x27;ve always hated you Copperfield   Then he was taken away</p>
<p>In the next few days Traddles and Micawber worked very hard together to put right what Uriah had done They discovered my aunt&#x27;s money and gave it back to her  and paid all the firm&#x27;s debts Mr Wickfield decided to sell his business  and retire  The Wickfields would not have much money  but at least they did not owe anything  In the end Uriah Heep and his mother left Canterbury  but we all thought he was too evil to stay out of trouble for long</p>
<p>My aunt had a wonderful idea for the Micawber family  Have you ever thought of going to live in Australia   she suggested   It&#x27;s a new country  with a lot of business opportunities</p>
<p>Mr Micawber was very interested   Something could easily turn up there   he agreed  My aunt generously offered to lend him the necessary money to pay for the journey  and the whole Micawber family started planning and packing immediately</p>
<p>When I returned to London  I realized my poor Dora was much worse  She stayed upstairs all the time now  and the sitting-room seemed very quiet without my little child-wife in her usual place One day when I was sitting with her in her room she said lovingly  You know  David dear  I&#x27;m afraid I was too young.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t say that Dora  I whispered conscious that she was speaking of herself in the past</p>
<p>I was a silly little girl  David  and you know it  It&#x27;s just as well that I won&#x27;t live much longer Perhaps if I lived you&#x27;d wish you&#x27;d married someone more sensible  more practical someone like   She did not finish what she was saying</p>
<p>But we&#x27;ve been so happy  Dora  I said trying not to cry.</p>
<p>She took my band and kissed it  We have  haven&#x27;t we David  do you think if you asked Agnes  she&#x27;d come and see me  I have something particular to say to her</p>
<p>Of course  my love  I&#x27;ll write to her tonight</p>
<p>Agnes came the next day  and went straight upstairs to see Dora Although the doctor and my aunt had told me there was no hope that Dora would live  when I held her hand and saw her love for me in her innocent blue eyes I could not believe she would be taken from me But when Agnes came downstairs so calmly and silently  and said nothing but raised her hand and pointed upwards I knew It was over and I remembered only darkness for a long time afterwards</p>
<p>In the middle of my terrible sadness I received a message from Emily She asked me to take a letter from her to Ham her last words to the man who had loved her so much  before she and Daniel left England for Australia  They were sailing in two weeks  time  and the Micawbers were going on the same ship. I remembered my childish love for little Emily  and agreed to do what she asked</p>
<p>The weather was very stormy as I travelled through the night to Yarmouth Several times the coach was almost knocked off the road by the wind and the rain  By the time we arrived in Yarmouth  most of the local people were in the streets  afraid to stay in their houses  in case the roof or the chimney blew down  Many women were crying  afraid for their husbands or brothers who were out fishing in their small boats  The sea itself  with its huge waves crashing noisily on the beach  frightened us all very much</p>
<p>I went to the hotel  and tried to sleep a little after my tiring journey  But the wind made so much noise that I could not sleep  and I went down to the beach again  where a lot of people were standing together  watching the waves  By now the storm had got even worse</p>
<p>Two ships have gone down  sir   a local fisherman shouted to me   A few miles away  We couldn&#x27;t save any of the men on them  The waves were too high  And look  There&#x27;s another</p>
<p>And suddenly I gasped in horror  I could see a great ship which had been pushed violently on to the rocks by the waves It was in danger of falling back into the waves  or of breaking in half  at any moment. Several figures were visible on the ship   especially one very active  curly-haired young man  who seemed to be giving orders  The crowd on the beach cried out as the ship rolled and a huge wave swept over it  carrying the men into the rushing water In a moment the only figure we could see was the curly-haired young man  holding desperately on to the side of the ship and calling for help  What could we do   It was certain death for any man to enter those waves</p>
<p>Just then I saw Ham Peggotty running through the crowd to the edge of tM water  One end of a rope was tied around his waist  and the other end was held firmly be three strong men standing on the beach</p>
<p>No  Ham  I cried trying to hold him back   Don&#x27;t try to rescue that poor sailor You&#x27;ll kill yourself</p>
<p>Let me go Master David  he replied cheerfully shaking both my hands   If God thinks it  s time for me to die  then I&#x27;m ready  Friends I&#x27;m going in Give me more rope</p>
<p>He dived in under a great wave  and swam strongly towards the ship  In another moment he would have reached it  when a high green hill of water appeared and the ship went down with a great crash The people on the beach pulled on Ham&#x27;s rope  and he arrived at my feet dead  They carried him to the nearest house  and I called a doctor  but nothing could be done for him He had been beaten to death by that great wave  and his generous heart had stopped for ever</p>
<p>As I sat hopelessly by his bed  a fisherman who had known me when Emily and I were children  came to tell me he recognized the curly-haired sailor  whose body had been thrown out of the water by the waves  I went to see  And there on the beach where she and I had played  I saw Steerforth lying with his handsome face on his arm  He would never smile at me or Emily again</p>
<p>I was surrounded by too many ghosts to return to London and my old life  I was selfishly sad that I had lost my child-wife and my childhood friend and sometimes I felt I wanted to die So I left England  and travelled for many months in Europe  I lived in a dark  miserable dream  with no hope or interest in my future</p>
<p>One evening I arrived in a village in Switzerland  and received a packet of letters that had been waiting for me  The first one I opened was from Agnes She gave me no advice but she told me simply that she trusted me to find a purpose in life and that she would always be proud of me  and love me as a sister</p>
<p>As the light died out of the sky and I watched the colour of the snow on the mountain tops change  I felt I was waking from my unhappy dream  and I began to understand how much I loved Agnes She had been the one who had always guided and supported me  and now I realized I needed her love for the rest of my life  Had falling in love with Dora been a mistake We had both been very young  it is true  I had always called Agnes sister  and now perhaps I no longer had the right to ask whether her love for me was more than sisterly</p>
<p>However  I decided to return  and travelled home to England  after three years of absence I was delighted to find that Traddles had married his Sophy  and was doing well as a lawyer  My aunt had moved back to her old Dover house  and was living happily there with Mr Dick and Peggotty  When I visited my aunt  I took the opportunity of asking her about Agnes.</p>
<p>Has she has she any young man she&#x27;d like to marry   I asked as lightly as possible</p>
<p>My aunt looked carefully at me as she replied   I suspect she has  David  She&#x27;s never mentioned it to me  but I think I feel sure she&#x27;s going to marry soon</p>
<p>I was firm with myself and did not show my feelings  I borrowed a horse and rode to Canterbury to ask Agnes myself When I saw that beautiful  gentle face again  I knew I had come home  I knew how dear she was to me  and would always be</p>
<p>Agnes  I said   I am so grateful to you  for making me what I am   for helping me to be good  But I think you have a secret  Let me share it  Agnes  as your brother  Tell me whom you love</p>
<p>Agnes turned away from me and burst into tears  Somehow these tears did not sadden me  but gave me hope   My dear Agnes Don&#x27;t cry</p>
<p>David  leave me  I can&#x27;t talk about it now   she sobbed</p>
<p>Agnes  you&#x27;re dearer to me than anything in the world Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be jealous of any man you choose to marry  I only want you to be happy</p>
<p>She had stopped crying now and was calmer   If I have a secret  David  it is not a new one  It has been my secret for a long time</p>
<p>I was wild with hope   Not a new one   Did she mean   Dearest Agnes  Dare I hope to call you more than a sister  She was in my arms and sobbing again  but this time with happiness.  I went away  Agnes  loving you I returned home  loving you</p>
<p>We held each other for some time  sure now of each other&#x27;s love</p>
<p>There is something I must tell you  David   she said gently looking calmly into my face  I have loved you all my life   She added   And something else before our sweet Dora died  she asked me can you guess to fill the empty place in your heart   And Agnes laid her head on my shoulder  and cried  And I cried with her  although we were both so happy</p>
<p>My story has almost come to an end  I have published several books now  and I am a well-known writer Agnes and I have been married for twenty years  and live in perfect happiness with our children around us  We have heard from Daniel Peggotty in Australia  He and Emily have made friends there and are happy Mr Micawber has become an important figure in a large Australian town  and his family are quite used to living there  My aunt  Mr Dick and Peggotty are all white-haired and old now  but still very fit  and they love playing with our children whenever they can  My old friend Traddles has two sons of his own  and will soon become a judge</p>
<p>When I think of my friends and family  Agnes&#x27;s lovely face shines above them all  She is here  next to me  as I write  and I hope that when my life comes to its end  she will be with me in the shadows  pointing upwards to the light</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a
