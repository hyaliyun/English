<p>1801 I have just returned from a visit to my landlord Mr  Heathcliff I am delighted with the house I am renting  from him Thrushcross Grange is miles away from any town or village That suits me perfectly And the scenery here in  Yorkshire is so beautiful</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff in fact is my only neighbour and I think  his character is similar to mine He does not like people either</p>
<p>My name is Lockwood  I said when I met him at the  gate to his house  I&#x27;m renting Thrushcross Grange from you  I just wanted to come and introduce myself</p>
<p>He said nothing but frowned and did not encourage me to  enter After a while however he decided to invite me in</p>
<p>Joseph take Mr Lock wood&#x27;s horse  he called  And  bring up some wine from the cellar  Joseph was a very old  servant with a sour expression on his face He looked crossly  up at me as he took my horse</p>
<p>God help us A visitor  he muttered to himself Perhaps  there were no other servants I thought And it seemed that  Mr Heathcliff hardly ever received guests</p>
<p>His house is called Wuthering Heights The name means a  windswept house on a hill  and it is a very good description The trees around the house do not grow straight but are bent  by the north wind which blows over the moors every day of  the year Fortunately the house is strongly built and is not  damaged even by the worst winter storms The name Earn shaw is cut into a stone over the front door.</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff and I entered the huge main room It could  have been any Yorkshire farmhouse kitchen except that there  was no sign of cooking and no farmer sitting at the table. Mr  Heathcliff certainly does not look like a farmer His hair and  skin are dark like a gipsy&#x27;s but he has the manners of a  gentleman He could perhaps take more care with his  appearance but he is handsome. I think he is proud and also  unhappy.</p>
<p>We sat down by the fire in silence.</p>
<p>Joseph &#x27;shouted Mr Heathcliff No answer came from the  cellar so he dived down there leaving me alone with several  rather fierce looking dogs. Suddenly one of them jumped  angrily up at me and in a moment all the others were attacking me From every shadowy corner in the great room appeared a growling animal ready to kill me it seemed.</p>
<p>Help Mr Heathcliff Help  I shouted trying to keep the  dogs back My landlord and his servant were in no hurry to  help and could not have climbed the cellar steps more slowly but luckily a woman who I supposed was the housekeeper rushed into the room to calm the dogs.</p>
<p>What the devil is the matter  Mr Heathcliff asked me  rudely when he finally entered the room.</p>
<p>Your dogs sir  I replied. You shouldn&#x27;t leave a stranger  with them They&#x27;re dangerous</p>
<p>Come come Mr Lockwood Have some wine We don&#x27;t often have strangers here and I&#x27;m afraid neither I nor my dogs  are used to receiving them</p>
<p>I could not feel offended after this and accepted the wine We sat drinking and talking together for a while I suggested  visiting him tomorrow He did not seem eager to see me  again but I shall go anyway.I am interested in him even if  he isn&#x27;t interested in me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Two days later Yesterday afternoon was misty and bitterly  cold but I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights and  arrived just as it was beginning to snow. I banged on the front  door for ten minutes getting colder and colder.Finally  Joseph&#x27;s head appeared at a window of one of the farm  buildings</p>
<p>What do you want  he growled</p>
<p>Could you let me in  I asked desperately</p>
<p>He shook his head  There&#x27;s only Mrs Heathcliff indoors and she won&#x27;t open the door to you</p>
<p>Just then a young man appeared and called me to follow  him We went through the back door and into the big room  where I had been before I was delighted to see a warm fire  and a table full of food And this time there was a woman  sitting by the fire She must be Mrs Heathcliff I thought I  had not imagined my landlord was married. She looked at me  coldly without saying anything</p>
<p>Terrible weather  I remarked There was silence</p>
<p>What a beautiful animal  I tried again pointing to one of  the dogs that had attacked me She still said nothing but got  up to make the tea She was only about seventeen with the  most beautiful little face I had ever seen Her golden wavy hair  fell around her shoulders</p>
<p>Have you been invited to tea &#x27;she asked me crossly</p>
<p>No but you are the proper person to invite me  I smiled</p>
<p>For some reason this really annoyed her She stopped  making the tea and threw herself angrily back in her chair. Meanwhile the young man was staring aggressively at me He  looked like a farm worker but seemed to be part of the  family I did not feel at all comfortable At last Heathcliff  came in.</p>
<p>Here I am sir as I promised  I said cheerfully</p>
<p>You shouldn&#x27;t have come  he answered shaking the  snow off his clothes  You&#x27;ll never find your way back in the  dark.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could lend me a servant to guide me back to  the Grange  I asked</p>
<p>No I couldn&#x27;t There aren&#x27;t any servants here except  Joseph and the housekeeper Get the tea ready will you  he  added fiercely to the young woman I was shocked by his  unpleasantness</p>
<p>We sat down to eat I tried to make conversation with the  three silent people round the table</p>
<p>How happy you must be Mr Heathcliff  I began  in  this quiet place with your wife and</p>
<p>My wife My wife&#x27;s ghost you mean</p>
<p>I suddenly realized I had made a serious mistake.So his wife  was dead Of course he was too old to be married to that young  girl. She must be married to the young man next to me who  was drinking his tea out of a bowl and eating his bread with  unwashed hands Perhaps the poor girl had found no one  better to marry in this uninhabited area I turned politely to  the young man.</p>
<p>Ah so you are this lady&#x27;s husband  This was worse than  before. His face went red and he seemed only just able to stop  himself hitting me He muttered something I could not hear</p>
<p>Wrong again Mr Lockwood &#x27;said Mr Heathcliff. No her husband my son is dead This  he added looking  scornfully at the young man  is certainly not my son.</p>
<p>My name is Hareton Earnshaw  growled the young man.</p>
<p>We finished our meal in silence and when I looked out of  the window all I could see was darkness and snow.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I can get home without a guide  I said  politely No one answered me I turned to the woman</p>
<p>Mrs Heathcliff  I begged  What can I do Please help  me</p>
<p>Take the road you came on &#x27;she replied without interest opening a book  That&#x27;s the best advice I can give</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff I&#x27;ll have to stay here for the night   I told  him</p>
<p>I hope that will teach you not to walk over the moors in  bad weather  he answered  I don&#x27;t keep guest bedrooms You can share a bed with Hareton or Joseph</p>
<p>I was so angry with them all that I could not stay there a  moment longer and rushed out into the darkness. I saw  Joseph by the back door caught hold of the lamp he was  carrying and ran with it to the gate But the dogs chased  after me and attacked me and I was soon knocked to the  ground Heathcliff and Hareton stood at the door laughing as I shouted at the dogs and tried to get up In the end I was  again rescued by the housekeeper Zillah who ordered away  the dogs and helped me to my feet</p>
<p>I was so bruised and exhausted that I did not feel strong  enough to walk home and although I did not want to I had  to spend the night at Wuthering Heights Nobody wished me  goodnight as Zillah took me upstairs to find a bed for me</p>
<p>2 Catherine Earnshaw&#x27;s room</p>
<p>1801 Quietly sir  whispered the housekeeper as we  climbed up the dark stairs  My master will be angry if  he discovers which bedroom you&#x27;re sleeping in.For some rea-son he doesn&#x27;t want anyone to sleep there I don&#x27;t know why They&#x27;re strange people in this house you know Here&#x27;s the  room sir.</p>
<p>But I was too tired to listen  Thank you Zillah  I said and taking the candle I entered the room and closed the  door.</p>
<p>The only piece of furniture in the large dusty bedroom was  a bed placed next to the window. There were heavy curtains  which could be pulled around it to hide the sleeper from  anyone else in the room Looking inside the curtains I saw a  little shelf full of books just under the window.I put my can-dle down on the shelf and dropped thankfully on to the bed I  closed the curtains around the bed and felt safe from  Heathcliff and everyone else at Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>I noticed that there were names written on the wall in childish handwriting Catherine Earnshaw Catherine Heathcliff  and Catherine Linton Then I fell asleep but I was woken  very suddenly by a smell of burning. My candle had fallen on  to a Bible on the shelf and was burning it When I opened the  Bible to see if it was damaged I found that wherever there  was an empty page or half a page someone had written on  it and on the first page was written  Catherine Earnshaw&#x27;s  diary 1776  Who was the girl who had slept in this bed written her name on the wall and then written her diary in  the Bible twenty-five years ago I read it with interest</p>
<p>How I hate my brother Hindley  it began  He is so cruel  to poor Heathcliff If only my father hadn&#x27;t died While he  was alive Heathcliff was like a brother to Hindley and me But now Hindley and his wife Frances have inherited the house  and the money and they hate Heathcliff.That horrible old  servant Joseph is always angry with Heathcliff and me because  we don&#x27;t pray or study the Bible and when he tells his  master Hindley always punishes us I can&#x27;t stop crying. Poor  Heathcliff Hindley says he is wicked and can&#x27;t play with me  or eat with me any more.</p>
<p>My eyes were beginning to close again and I fell asleep Never before had I passed such a terrible night disturbed by  the most frightening dreams Suddenly I was woken by a  gentle knocking on the window. It must be the branch of a  tree I thought and tried to sleep again Outside I could hear  the wind driving the snow against the window</p>
<p>But I could not sleep The knocking annoyed me so much  that I tried to open the window. When it did not open  I  broke the glass angrily and stretched out my hand towards the  branch But instead my fingers closed around a small ice cold hand It held my hand tightly and a voice cried sadly  Let me in Let me in</p>
<p>Who are you  I asked trying to pull my hand away</p>
<p>Catherine Linton  it replied  I&#x27;ve come home I lost my  way  There seemed to be a child&#x27;s face looking in at the  window.</p>
<p>Terror made me cruel. I rubbed the creature&#x27;s tiny wrist  against the broken glass so that blood poured down on to the  bed As soon as the cold fingers let go for a moment I pulled  my hand quickly back put a pile of books in front of the  broken window and tried not to listen to the desperate cries  outside.</p>
<p>Go away  I called  I&#x27;ll never let you in not if you go on  crying for twenty years</p>
<p>It is almost twenty years &#x27;replied the sad little voice  I&#x27;ve been out here in the dark for nearly twenty years  The  hand started pushing through the window at the pile of books and I knew it would find me and catch hold of me again Unable to move I stared in horror at the shape behind the  glass and screamed.</p>
<p>There were rapid footsteps outside my bedroom door and  then I saw the light of a candle in the room</p>
<p>Is anyone here  whispered Heathcliff He could not see  me behind the curtains and clearly did not expect an answer.I knew I could not hide from him so I opened the curtains  wide.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the effect of my action Heathcliff  dropped his candle and stood without moving his face as  white as the wall behind him He did not seem to recognize  me.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s only your guest Lockwood  I said  I&#x27;m sorry I  must have had a bad dream and screamed in my sleep</p>
<p>To the devil with you Mr Lockwood  growled my landlord  Who allowed you to sleep in this room Who was it</p>
<p>It was your housekeeper Mr Heathcliff  I said quickly  putting my clothes on  And I&#x27;m angry with her myself  No  one can sleep in a room full of ghosts</p>
<p>What do you mean  asked Heathcliff looking suddenly  very interested. Ghosts you say</p>
<p>That little girl Catherine Linton or Earnshaw or whatever her name was must have been wicked She told me she  had been a ghost for nearly twenty years It was probably a  punishment for her wickedness</p>
<p>How dare you speak of her to me  cried Heathcliff  wildly But as I described my dream he became calmer and  sat down on the bed trembling as he tried to control his  feelings.</p>
<p>Mr Lockwood  he said finally brushing a tear from his  eye  you can go into my bedroom to sleep for the rest of the  night I&#x27;ll stay here for a while</p>
<p>No more sleep for me tonight  I replied  I&#x27;ll wait in the  kitchen until it&#x27;s daylight and then I&#x27;ll leave You needn&#x27;t  worry about my visiting you again either I&#x27;ve had enough  company for a long time</p>
<p>But as I turned to go downstairs my landlord thinking he  was alone threw himself on the bed pushed open the window  and called into the darkness  Come in Come in  he cried tears rolling down his face  Catherine do come My darling hear me this time</p>
<p>But only the snow and wind blew into the room.</p>
<p>How could my dream have produced such madness I could  not watch his suffering any more and went downstairs.</p>
<p>I waited in the kitchen until it was light enough outside for  me to find my way through the deep snow back to Thrushcross  Grange. The housekeeper there Ellen Dean rushed out to  welcome me home. She thought I must have died in the  previous night&#x27;s snowstorm With a warm fire and a hot  meal I began to recover from my unpleasant experiences</p>
<p>After my stay at Wuthering Heights I thought I would  never want to speak to any human being again but by the end  of the next day I was beginning to feel lonely I decided to ask  Mrs Dean to sit with me after supper.</p>
<p>How long have you lived in this house  I asked her</p>
<p>Eighteen years sir. I came here early in 1783 when my  mistress was married to look after her. And when she died I  stayed here as housekeeper.</p>
<p>Who was your mistress  I asked.</p>
<p>Her name was Catherine Earnshaw &#x27;she replied.</p>
<p>Ah my ghostly Catherine  I muttered quietly to myself.</p>
<p>She married Mr Edgar Linton a neighbour  added Mrs  Dean  and they had a daughter Cathy who married Mr  Heathcliff&#x27;s son.</p>
<p>Ah so that must be the widow young Mrs Heathcliff at  Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right sir Did you see her I looked after her as a  baby you know. How is she I do want to know.</p>
<p>She looked very well and very beautiful But I don&#x27;t think  she&#x27;s happy</p>
<p>Oh poor thing And what did you think of Mr  Heathcliff</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a rough hard man Mrs Dean But I&#x27;m very  interested in him Tell me more about him.</p>
<p>Well he&#x27;s very rich of course and mean at the same  time He could live here at Thrushcross Grange which is a  finer house than Wuthering Heights but he would rather  receive rent than live comfortably But I&#x27;ll tell you the whole  story of his life as much as I know that is and then you can  judge for yourself.</p>
<p>3 Ellen Dean&#x27;s story Catherine and Heathcliff as children</p>
<p>1770 When I was a child I was always at Wuthering  Heights because my mother was a servant with the  Earnshaw family They are a very old family who have lived in  that house for centuries as you can see from their name on the  stone over the front door. I grew up with Catherine and  Hindley Earnshaw and we three played together as children.</p>
<p>One day their father Mr Earnshaw came back from a long  journey. He had travelled sixty miles to Liverpool and back on  business and was very tired.</p>
<p>Look what I&#x27;ve brought you  he told us all unwrapping  something he was holding carefully in his arms Catherine and  Hindley were expecting presents and they rushed eagerly to  see what it was. They were very disappointed to see only a  dirty black-haired gipsy child.</p>
<p>I found him all alone in the busy streets of Liverpool  Mr  Earnshaw explained to them  and I couldn&#x27;t leave him to die  He can sleep in your room  But Hindley and Catherine were  angry because they had not received any presents and refused  to let the strange child share their room However Mr Earn shaw insisted and little by little the boy became accepted by the family He was called Heathcliff as a first and last name No one ever discovered who his parents had been</p>
<p>Catnerine and he became great friends but Hindley hated  him and was often cruel to him Old Mr Earnshaw was strangely fond of this gipsy child and frequently punished his son for behaving badly to Heathcliff Hindley began to be jealous of his father&#x27;s feelings for Heathcliff and saw them both as enemies</p>
<p>This situation could not last As Mr Earnshaw grew old and ill Heathcliff became even more his favourite and Hindley often quarrelled with his father When Hindley was sent away to study I hoped that we would have peace in the house But then it was that old servant Joseph who caused trouble He tried to persuade his master to be stricter with the children and was always complaining that Heathcliff and Catherine did not spend enough time studying the Bible or attending church services</p>
<p>Catherine was a wild wicked girl in those days We had to watch her every moment of the day to stop her playing her tricks on us She was proud and liked giving orders But she had the prettiest face and the sweetest smile you&#x27;ve ever seen I could forgive her anything when she came to say she was sorry.</p>
<p>She was much too fond of Heathcliff and the worst punishment we could invent was to keep her separate from him Her father could no longer understand her or her behaviour and Catherine did not realize that his illness made him less patient with her</p>
<p>At last Mr Earnshaw found peace He died quietly in his chair by the fire one October evening in 1775 The night was wild and stormy and we were all sitting together in the big kitchen Joseph was reading his Bible at the table while Catherine had her head on her father&#x27;s knee He was pleased to see her so gentle for once and she was singing him to sleep I was glad the old gentleman was sleeping so well But when it was time to go to bed Catherine put her arms round her father&#x27;s neck to say goodnight and immediately screamed  Oh he&#x27;s dead Heathcliff He&#x27;s dead</p>
<p>Heathcliff and I started crying loudly and bitterly too Joseph told me to fetch the doctor so I ran to the village although I knew it was too late When I came back I went to the children&#x27;s room to see if they needed me and I listened for a moment at their door. They were imagining the dead man in a beautiful distant place far from the troubles of this world And as I listened crying silently I could not help wishing we were all there safe together.</p>
<p>4 Catherine Earnshaw gets to know the Lintons</p>
<p>1775 Hindley came home for his father&#x27;s burial What was more surprising was that he brought a wife with him She was called Frances a thin pale woman with a frequent cough Now that Hindley was the master of the house he ordered Joseph and me to spend our evenings in the small back-kitchen as we were only servants while he his wife and Catherine sat in the main room Catherine and Heathcliff were treated very differently Catherine received presents and could continue her lessons but Heathcliff was made to work on the farm with the men and as a farm worker was only allowed to eat with us in the backkitchen They grew up like two wild animals Hindley did not care what they did as long as they kept out of his way and they did not care even if he punished them They often ran away on to the moors in the morning and stayed out all day just to make Hindley angry I was the only one who cared what happened to the two poor creatures and I was afraid for them</p>
<p>One Sunday evening they were missing at bedtime and Hindley ordered me angrily to lock the front door But I did not want them to stay out in the cold all night so I kept my window open to look out for them In a while I saw Heathcliff walking through the gate I was shocked to see him alone</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s Catherine  I cried sharply</p>
<p>At Thrushcross Grange with our neighbours the Lintons  he replied  Let me in Ellen and I&#x27;ll explain what happened  I went down to unlock the door and we came upstairs very quietly</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t wake the master up  I whispered  Now tell me</p>
<p>Well Catherine and I thought we d just walk to the Lintons house We wanted to see if Isabella and Edgar Linton are punished all the time by their parents as we are</p>
<p>Probably not  I answered  I expect they are good children and don&#x27;t need to be punished</p>
<p>Nonsense Ellen Guess what we saw when we looked in at their sittingroom window A very pretty room with soft carpets and white walls Catherine and I would love to have a room like that But in the middle of this beautiful room Isabella and Edgar Linton were screaming and fighting over a little dog How stupid they are Ellen If Catherine wanted something I would give it to her and she would do the same for me I would rather be here at Wuthering Heights with her even if I&#x27;m punished by Joseph and that wicked Hindley that at Thrushcross Grange with those two fools</p>
<p>Not so loud Heathcliff But you still haven&#x27;t told me why Catherine isn&#x27;t with you</p>
<p>Well as we were looking in we started laughing at them so loudly that they heard us and sent the dogs after us We were about to run away when a great fierce dog caught Catherine&#x27;s leg in its teeth I attacked it and made it let go of her leg but the Lintons&#x27; servants appeared and caught hold of me. They must have thought we were robbers Catherine was carried unconscious into the house and they pulled me inside too All the time I was shouting and swearing at them</p>
<p>What a wicked pair of thieves  said old Mr Linton  The boy must be a gipsy he&#x27;s as dark as the devil  Mrs Linton raised her hands in horror at the sight of me Catherine opened her eyes and Edgar looked closely at her</p>
<p>Mother  he whispered  the young lady is Miss Earn-shaw of Wuthering Heights. I&#x27;ve seen her in church occasionally And look what our dog has done to her leg It&#x27;s bleeding badly</p>
<p>Miss Earnshaw with a gipsy  cried Mrs Linton  Surely not But I think you must be right Edgar This girl is wearing black and Mr Earnshaw died recently It must be her I d better put a bandage on her leg at once.</p>
<p>Why does her brother Hindley let her run around with such a companion  wondered Mr Linton  I remember now he&#x27;s the gipsy child Mr Earnshaw brought home from Liverpool a few years ago.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a wicked boy you can see that  said Mrs Linton  And did you hear the bad language he used just now I&#x27;m shocked that my children heard it.</p>
<p>I was pushed out into the garden but I stayed to watch through the window They put Catherine on a comfortable sofa cleaned her wound and fed her with cakes and wine I only left the house when I was sure she was well taken care of She&#x27;s a breath of fresh air for those stupid Lintons I&#x27;m not surprised they like her Everybody who sees her must love her mustn&#x27;t they Ellen</p>
<p>I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll be punished for this Heathcliff  I said sadly</p>
<p>And I was right Hindley warned Heathcliff that he must never speak to Catherine again or he would be sent away from Wuthering Heights and it was decided that Catherine would be taught to behave like a young lady</p>
<p>She stayed with the Linton family at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks until Christmas By that time her leg was fine and her manners were much better than before Frances Earn-shaw visited her often bringing her pretty dresses to wear and persuading her to take care of her appearance so that when she finally came home after her long absence she almost seemed a different person Instead of a wild hatless girl we saw a beautiful carefully dressed young lady</p>
<p>When she had greeted all of us she asked for Heathcliff</p>
<p>Come forward Heathcliff  called Hindley  You may welcome Miss Catherine home like the other servants</p>
<p>Heathcliff was used to being outside all day and had not bothered to wash or change his clothes His face and hands were black with dirt In spite of this Catherine was very glad to see him and rushed up to kiss him Then she laughed</p>
<p>How funny and black and cross you look But that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to Edgar and Isabella who are always so clean and tidy. Well Heathcliff have you forgotten me</p>
<p>But ashamed and proud the boy said nothing until suddenly his feelings were too much for him</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t stay to be laughed at  he cried and was about to run away when Catherine caught hold of his hand.</p>
<p>Why are you angry Heathcliff You you just look a bit strange that&#x27;s all You&#x27;re so dirty</p>
<p>She looked worriedly at her hands and her new dress</p>
<p>You needn&#x27;t have touched me  he said pulling away his hand  I like being dirty and I&#x27;m going to be dirty</p>
<p>As he ran miserably out of the room Hindley and his wife laughed loudly delighted that their plan to separate the two young people seemed to be succeeding.</p>
<p>The next day was Christmas Day Edgar and Isabella Linton had been invited to lunch and their mother had agreed on condition that her darlings were kept carefully apart from that wicked boy  I felt sorry for poor Heathcliff and while the Earnshaws were at church  I helped him wash and dress in clean clothes</p>
<p>You&#x27;re too proud  I scolded him as I brushed his black hair  You should think how sad Catherine is when you can&#x27;t be together And don&#x27;t be jealous of Edgar Linton</p>
<p>I wish I had blue eyes and fair hair like him I wish I behaved well and was going to inherit a fortune</p>
<p>He has none of your intelligence or character And if you have a good heart you&#x27;ll have a handsome face. Who knows who your parents were Perhaps a king and queen far more important than the Lintons</p>
<p>In this way I encouraged Heathcliff to have more confidence in himself. But when the Earnshaws and the Lintons arrived back from church the first thing Hindley did was shout at Heathcliff.</p>
<p>Get out of my sight until we&#x27;ve finished eating  I&#x27;ll pull that long hair of yours if you don&#x27;t obey me at once</p>
<p>It is long &#x27;said Edgar. I&#x27;m surprised he can see anything</p>
<p>This was too much for Heathcliff  He looked desperately around for a weapon picked up a bowl of hot soup and threw it at Edgar who started screaming. Hindley immediately took hold of Heathcliff and pushed him upstairs.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure Hindley&#x27;s going to hit him  cried Catherine. I hate it when Heathcliff is punished  It&#x27;s your fault  Edgar  you annoyed him Why did you speak to him</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t   replied Edgar tears in his eyes  I promised Mother I wouldn&#x27;t I spoke about him  not to him</p>
<p>Well don&#x27;t cry &#x27;said Catherine with scorn  You&#x27;ve made enough trouble already. Here comes my brother.</p>
<p>Hindley returned hot and breathless</p>
<p>That&#x27;ll teach him  he said  And now let&#x27;s have lunch</p>
<p>The others seemed to forget Heathcliff but I noticed Catherine could not eat much and I knew she was sorry for her friend In the evening there was music from a travelling band and dancing in the main room. Catherine said the music sounded sweeter from high up and so she went to sit in the dark on the stairs When I went to find her however I discovered she had gone right to the top of the house to talk to Heathcliff through his locked bedroom door and had then climbed out on to the roof and in through his window I persuaded them both to come out of the room the same way  as I had no key to the door and took Heathcliff down into the warm servants kitchen with me while Catherine returned to her guests and the dancing</p>
<p>You must be hungry Heathcliff  I said. You haven&#x27;t eaten all day. Have some Christmas cake do.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t eat anything  he growled putting his head in his hands  I&#x27;ve got to think how I can have my revenge on Hindley I only hope he doesn&#x27;t die first He&#x27;ll be sorry he&#x27;s treated me like this Ellen</p>
<p>5 Catherine and Edgar</p>
<p>1778 In the summer of this year Hindley&#x27;s wife Frances had her first and last baby They called the boy Hareton But the poor woman had been ill for a long time  although we had not realized it and died soon after Hareton was born</p>
<p>Hindley only had room in his heart for two people himself and his wife so when she died he was in despair. He neither cried nor prayed. Instead he swore at God and man and drank himself to sleep every night The servants all left him except for Joseph and me Joseph enjoyed being able to scold his wicked employer with warnings from the Bible and I could not leave Miss Catherine. After all I had grown up with her and Hindley.</p>
<p>But the master&#x27;s behaviour was a bad example for Catherine and Heathcliff.At fifteen Catherine was the most beautiful girl for miles around but she was proud and quick tempered. She led what was almost a double life. At Wuthering Heights under Heathcliff&#x27;s influence she annoyed Hindley laughed at Joseph and was rude to me But at Thrushcross Grange which she often visited she showed a different calmer side of her character and was polite intelligent and amusing. The Lintons all liked her and poor Edgar had fallen in love with her.</p>
<p>Heathcliff was sixteen at this time. He did not have time to study any more and the long hours of work on the farm made him tired and dull. There was always an angry expression on his face and he did not even try to keep himself clean and tidy He seemed to want people to dislike him Catherine and he still spent time together when he was not working in the fields but he no longer expressed his fondness for her in words and he looked angry if she touched or kissed him</p>
<p>One afternoon when Hindley had gone into town Heath  cliff came into the main room after lunch. I was helping Catherine to arrange her hair as she had invited Edgar Linton to visit her while Hindley was absent</p>
<p>Catherine are you going anywhere this afternoon  asked Heathcliff  Why have you got that silk dress on Nobody&#x27;s visiting you I hope</p>
<p>No-o I don&#x27;t think so &#x27;replied Catherine looking quickly at me  But you should be at work by now Heathcliff</p>
<p>That devil Hindley isn&#x27;t away very often I&#x27;m taking a holiday I won&#x27;t work any more today  I&#x27;m staying with you this afternoon He&#x27;ll never know</p>
<p>Catherine thought for a moment. Somehow she had to prepare him for Edgar&#x27;s visit  Isabella and Edgar said they might call here this afternoon If they come you&#x27;ll be scolded for not working</p>
<p>Tell Ellen to say you&#x27;re busy and can&#x27;t see them  he said  Those friends of yours take up all your time You spend most of your evenings with them not with me</p>
<p>Well why should I always spend my time with you &#x27;she asked crossly  What can you talk about How can you amuse me</p>
<p>You never told me before that you didn&#x27;t like my company Catherine  cried Heathcliff</p>
<p>Just then we heard a horse outside  and there was a light knock on the door Edgar Linton entered his handsome face full of delight at receiving Catherine&#x27;s unexpected invitation  I wondered if Catherine was comparing her two friends  as Edgar came in and Heathcliff ran out</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t come too soon have I  asked Edgar politely</p>
<p>No  answered Catherine  Leave us alone Ellen</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just doing my work miss  I replied pretending to dust the furniture Hindley had told me to be present if Edgar Linton came to visit Catherine</p>
<p>She came up to me and whispered crossly  Go away Ellen  Keeping her back to Edgar she cruelly scratched my arm</p>
<p>Oh   I screamed to show Edgar what had happened  What a wicked thing to do miss You have no right to hurt me</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t touch you you lying creature &#x27;she cried angrily and unable to control herself hit me hard on the face</p>
<p>Catherine love Catherine  cried Edgar shocked</p>
<p>The baby Hareton who followed me everywhere immediately started sobbing and saying  Wicked aunt Catherine</p>
<p>She picked him up and shook the poor child until he screamed Edgar rushed up to her and tried to stop her At once she turned and hit him over the ear as hard as she could</p>
<p>The young man looked very pale and went straight to the door</p>
<p>Where are you going Edgar Linton &#x27;she asked  Don&#x27;t leave me I shall be miserable all night</p>
<p>Can I stay after you have hit me  he replied  You&#x27;ve made me afraid and ashamed of you I won&#x27;t come here again</p>
<p>Well go then if you want to &#x27;she cried  I&#x27;m going to cry until I&#x27;m ill  and she dropped on to the floor her shoulders shaking and the tears rolling down her face  Edgar managed to get as far as the door But here he hesitated and I called out to him to encourage him to leave</p>
<p>Miss is just a selfish child sir You d better ride home and forget her</p>
<p>But as he could not stop looking at her I knew there was no hopeKfor him Nothing would keep him away from her now And sure enough he came back into the room and shut the door This time I left them alone and stayed in the kitchen with little Hareton but when I came to warn them that Hindley had returned I realized that their quarrel had only brought them closer together</p>
<p>6 Heathcliff disappears</p>
<p>1778 9 Hindley came into the kitchen swearing terribly just as I was about to hide little Hareton in a cupboard I was always afraid that Hindley would hurt his small son either by accident or on purpose when he was drunk so I tried to keep Hareton out of the way But this time Hindley discovered my plan</p>
<p>Ah you keep my son in a cupboard do you  he cried angrily picking up a sharp kitchen knife  With the devil&#x27;s help I&#x27;ll make you swallow this Ellen  And he pushed the knife between my teeth</p>
<p>I was never afraid he would hurt me and calmly took the knife out of my mouth</p>
<p>But that can&#x27;t be my son can it  he continued aggressively staring at the frightened littlebboy  If it is he should be punished for not running to greet his father Perhaps I&#x27;ll cut his ears off  And then suddenly his manner changed  No Hareton darling don&#x27;t cry Kiss me kiss your father What You won&#x27;t Then I&#x27;ll break your neck</p>
<p>Poor Hareton screaming wildly was carried upstairs by his father Suddenly Hindley stopped on the stairs to listen almost forgetting what he was holding Heathcliff had come into the house and stood at the bottom of the stairs looking up Just then the child jumped out of Hindley&#x27;s arms and fell I onlyhhad time to gasp inkhorror before I saw that Heathcliff had caught him</p>
<p>Heathcliff stared down at the child he was holding He must have felt sorry he had saved the life of his enemy&#x27;s son I rushed to take the poor little boy in my arms and Hindley came slowly downstairs</p>
<p>Look what you&#x27;ve done Mr Hindley  I cried  You nearly killed your own son What would his mother say if she were alive</p>
<p>Take him away Ellen And you Heathcliff go away too I won&#x27;t murder you tonight unless perhaps I set the house on fire But that depends how I feel  And he poured himself a drink</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t drink any more Mr Hindley  I begged</p>
<p>What difference does it make  he growled  Get out both of you To the devil with you</p>
<p>We left him swearing at us and went back into the kitchen</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pity he can&#x27;t kill himself with drink &#x27;muttered Heathcliff  Dr Kenneth says he&#x27;ll live longer than any of us he&#x27;s so strong</p>
<p>He walked out of the door and I thought into the fields In fact I discovered later that he was sitting just under the window and could hear everything that was said in the kitchen</p>
<p>I was singing little Hareton to sleep when Catherine came in</p>
<p>Are you alone Ellen &#x27;she whispered  Where&#x27;s Heath cliff</p>
<p>He&#x27;s out on the farm  I answered</p>
<p>She looked sad and worried and I even saw a tear or two on her face But I had not forgotten how she had lied and behaved so badly to me as well as to Edgar Linton so I did not feel sorry for her or encourage her to talk</p>
<p>Ellen will you keep a secret for me &#x27;she asked in the end giving me her sweetest smile  I must tell you I need your advice Today Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him and I gave him an answer Now before I tell you if it was yes or no you tell me which I should have said</p>
<p>Really Miss Catherine how can I know Perhaps you should have refused him He must be a fool to ask you after you were so rude and violent this afternoon</p>
<p>Well I accepted him Ellen &#x27;she said crossly  But should I have done so Should I What do you think</p>
<p>First do you love him  I asked</p>
<p>Of course I do &#x27;she replied</p>
<p>Why do you love him Miss Catherine</p>
<p>Well I do that&#x27;s enough Well because he&#x27;s handsome and a pleasant companion</p>
<p>Oh that&#x27;s bad  I said shaking my head</p>
<p>And because he loves me</p>
<p>That&#x27;s worse</p>
<p>Andhbecause he&#x27;ll be rich and I shall be the most important woman for miles around</p>
<p>Worst of all But there are several other handsome rich young men in the world Why don&#x27;t you marry one of them</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know any of them I only know Edgar</p>
<p>Well I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re unhappy Miss Catherine Your brother will be pleased and Mr Edgar&#x27;s parents will too You love Edgar and Edgar loves you What&#x27;s the problem</p>
<p>here And here &#x27;replied Catherine beating her head and her chest  In my heart and soul I know I&#x27;m wrong Ellen I can&#x27;t live apart from Heathcliff He is more myself than I am Our souls are the same I have nothing in common with Edgar But I can&#x27;t marry Heathcliff now Hindley has made him become a poor dull farm worker He&#x27;ll never know how I love him</p>
<p>I suddenly heard a movement outside the window and saw Heathcliff stand up and walk away I realized he had been listening until he heard Catherine say she could not marry him Then he stayed to hear no more</p>
<p>Quiet Miss Q Catherine  I said  Just imagine how hard it will be for Heathcliff when you marry Mr Edgar He&#x27;ll have no friends at all when you leave him</p>
<p>Leave him Why should we be separated &#x27;she asked angrily  Who will separate us Nobody will dare Edgar must learn to accept him as my friend Didn&#x27;t you ever think Ellen that if Heathcliff and I married we would be very poor But if I marry Edgar I can help Heathcliff with my husband&#x27;s money</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the worst reason you&#x27;ve given so far for marrying Mr Edgar  I replied shocked.</p>
<p>It isn&#x27;t Heathcliff is more important to me than myself My love for Edgar is like the leaves on the trees I&#x27;m sure time will change it But my love for Heathcliff is like the rocks in the ground not beautiful but necessary and unchanging He&#x27;s always always in my heart</p>
<p>Just then Joseph entered the kitchen I whispered to Catherine that I was sure Heathcliff had heard some of what she said She jumped up frightened and rushed outside But although we all looked everywhere for Heathcliff there was no sign of him that night or for many nights in the future</p>
<p>At about midnight while we were still waiting for him to come home we noticed the wind was getting stronger We could hear it whistling down the chimney and howling all around the house Suddenly there was a terrible crash of thunder and the branch of a tree fell on to the roof We were not hurt but Joseph immediately dropped on to his knees to pray The rain was beating down on the windows but Catherine stayed outside although by now her hair and clothes were completely wet</p>
<p>In the end we all went to bed I managed to persuade Catherine to come in but she insisted on sleeping in the kitchen in case Heathcliff returned during the night In the morning we discovered that she had caught a fever as a result of getting wet She became seriously ill and it was several weekshbefore Dr Kenneth would allow her out of bed</p>
<p>When she recovered she was invited to stay for a while at Thrushcross Grange Unfortunately old Mr and Mrs Linton caught the fever too and died within a few days of each other Catherine returned to us prouder and quicker-tempered than ever but not as strong as before</p>
<p>If she gets ill again it could be fatal  Dr Kenneth warned us  My advice to you is to do whatever she wants and don&#x27;t make her angry  So we had to obey all her orders and Joseph and I were not allowed to scold her any more</p>
<p>Edgar Linton was still in love with her and thought himself the happiest man on earth when he married her three years after his parents death She insisted on having me with her so we moved together to Thrushcross Grange although I was very sad to leave little Hareton with his father</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very late Mr Lockwood I think you should go to bed or you&#x27;ll be ill tomorrow I can tell you the rest of the story another time</p>
<p>Four weeks later In fact I was ill the next day and have been ill since then The terrible night I spent at Wuthering Height was the cause of my illness and I blame Mr Heathcliff for it Dr Kenneth has warned me I won&#x27;t be able to go out until the spring All I can do is lie in bed listening to the howling wind and staring at the grey northern sky</p>
<p>So I&#x27;ve decided to ask Mrs Dean to come upstairs and finish telling me her story She tells me she&#x27;s happy to continue</p>
<p>7 Heathcliff returns</p>
<p>1783 Well sir when Miss Catherine became Mrs Linton and we went to live at Thrushcross Grange I must say I was surprised and pleased by her behaviour She showed great fondness for her husband and for his sister Isabella He of course was very anxious that no one should disobey her or make her angry If she was depressed for a time he blamed it on the illness she had had and was sympathetic But for most of the time I believe they shared a deep and growing love for each other</p>
<p>Unfortunately this happiness did not last One evening I was bringing in a basket of apples from the garden when a voice behind me said  Ellen is that you</p>
<p>It was a deep rather unusual voice I turned to see a tall dark man in the shadow near the kitchen door</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you know me  he asked  Look I&#x27;m not a stranger</p>
<p>What  I cried in surprise for it had been four years since he dusappeared  Heathcliff Is it really you</p>
<p>Yes  he replied looking up at the windows of the house  Are they at home Where is she Tell me Ellen I must speak to her</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you should see her  I hesitated  Will the shock be too much for her</p>
<p>Go and tell her I&#x27;m here Ellen  he said impatiently  Don&#x27;t make me suffer like this</p>
<p>I left him at the door and went upstairs to find Mr and Mrs Linton They were sitting quietly together looking out over the peaceful valley The room and the view and the two people seemed so calm that I did not want to disturb them But I had to deliver my message</p>
<p>A man wants to see you madam  I muttered</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go downstairs and see him then &#x27;replied Catherine  Bring the tea up Ellen while I&#x27;m away  She left the room</p>
<p>Who is it Ellen  asked Mr Edgar</p>
<p>It&#x27;s that Heathcliff sir You remember he used to live at Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>What The gipsy who worked on the farm  he cried</p>
<p>Mrs Linton would be angry if she heardpyou talking about him like that sir She was very upset when he ran away She&#x27;s very fond of him you know</p>
<p>Mr Edgar put his head out of the window and called to his wife  Don&#x27;t stand there in the cold love Bring the person in if it&#x27;s anyone special</p>
<p>Catherine rushed upstairs and into the room wild and breathless She threw her arms round her husband&#x27;s neck</p>
<p>Oh Edgar darling Heathcliff&#x27;s come back</p>
<p>Well well &#x27;said Mr Edgar crossly  there&#x27;s no need to get excited</p>
<p>I know you didn&#x27;t like him &#x27;she said  but please I beg you tobbe friends with him now Shall I ask him to come up</p>
<p>You&#x27;re suggesting inviting him up here into our siting room Don&#x27;t you think the kitchen is more suitable for him</p>
<p>Catherine looked at her husband half angry and half laughing  No &#x27;she said  I can&#x27;t sit in the kitchen Ellen bring two tables one for your master and Miss Isabella the other for Heathcliff and myself We&#x27;ll sit apart from them as we&#x27;re of a lower class Will that please you Edgar darling Decide quickly I must have him near me</p>
<p>Ellen you go and bring him up &#x27;said Mr Edgar  And Catherine try not to behave foolishly Remember he&#x27;s only a servant</p>
<p>When Heathcliff entered the sitting-room I was surprised to see how much he had changed He wore a confident intelligent expression on his face and his manner was no longer rough Although I recognized the same black fire in his eyes the farm boy had become a gentleman</p>
<p>Mr Edgar was as surprised as I was but welcomed Heath cliff as politely as he could However he grew more and more annoyed as he watched his wife&#x27;s delighted face She could not take her eyes off Heathcliff</p>
<p>Tomorrow I won&#x27;t be able tohbelieve that I&#x27;ve seen and touched you Heathcliff &#x27;she cried catching hold of his hands  But how cruel of you to run away and keep silent for four years and never think of me</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve thought of you more than you&#x27;ve thought of me  he replied quietly  I heard you had married Catherine and I came just to see you once and then take my revenge on your brother Hindley Your welcome may change my plans You know I&#x27;ve had a bitter hard life since I last heard your voice and If I&#x27;ve survived it&#x27;s all because of you</p>
<p>Catherine &#x27;said Mr Edgar trying to remain polite  please pour out the tea or it will be cold Mr Heathcliff will have a long walk to wherever he&#x27;s staying tonight and I&#x27;m thirsty</p>
<p>But Catherine was too excited and Mr Edgar too angry to drink any tea After a while their guest left We discovered that he had been invited to stay at Wuthering Heights by Hindley I could not understand why Hindley who hated him would want his company and I felt sure it would have been better for all of us if Heathcliff had never come back</p>
<p>Catherine could not keep her happiness to herself In the middle of the night she woke me to talk about Heathcliff</p>
<p>I just can&#x27;t sleep Ellen &#x27;she said  And Edgar won&#x27;t lis ten when I tell him how happy I am He&#x27;s so selfish</p>
<p>He never liked Heathcliff  I replied  and he&#x27;ll be angry if you go on talking about him You think he&#x27;s weak but he could be as determined as you about something he thinks is important</p>
<p>No &#x27;she laughed  I have such confidence in Edgar&#x27;s love that I think I could kill him and he wouldn&#x27;t blame me for it He will have to learn to accept Heathcliff as my friend</p>
<p>Do you know why Heathcliff is staying at Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>Oh yes He explained that he went there to look for me Hindley asked him to play cards and when he discovered Heathcliff had a lot of money invited him to stay there You know how greedy my brother is He&#x27;ll make Heathcliff pay rent and hope to win money from him at cards Heathcliff wants to stay there to be near me I&#x27;m so happy Ellen And I want everyone around me to be happy too</p>
<p>Catherine behaved so sweetly to her husband in the next few days that Thrushcross Grange seemed full of sunshine and in spite of his doubts Mr Edgar allowed Heathcliff to visit her regularly However Heathcliff&#x27;s visits produced a result which none of us had expected Isabella Mr Edgar&#x27;s sister a pretty girl of eighteen suddenly declared that she was in love with Heathcliff Mr Edgar who loved her dearly was shocked He knew that if he and Catherine had no sons Isabella would inherit the considerable Linton fortune He did not like the idea of the fortune passing to Heathcliff as Isabella&#x27;s husband But more importantly he suspected that Heathcliff was hiding his ture wickedness under his gentleman ly appearance</p>
<p>Catherine tried hard to persuade Isabella that Heathcliff was not worth loving but poor Isabella was jealous of Catherine&#x27;s relationship with Heathcliff and would not listen Finally Catherine told Heathcliff himself that Isabella was in love with him She thought she knew what his answer would be</p>
<p>How could I ever love that stupid girl  he asked  She has a miserable pale face and weak blue eyes just like your husband But she will inherit the family wealth from him won&#x27;t she</p>
<p>That&#x27;s true &#x27;replied Catherine  But don&#x27;t think about that Heathcliff I hope Edgar and I will have several sons and then they will inherit it</p>
<p>Catherine did not speak of this matter again but I am sure Heathcliff often thought about it I watched him carefully in the next few days I hoped he would do nothing to hurt Mr Edgar who was a kind master to me I was worried too about what was happening at Wuthering Heights Hindley and his son Hareton seemed like lost sheep to me and I knew there was a wicked wolf just waiting for the chance to attack them</p>
<p>8 Catherine is ill</p>
<p>1783 The next time Heathcliff came to Thrushcross Grange he met Isabella by chance in front of the house I was watching from the kitchen window as he went up to her and supposing that no one else could see him kissed her</p>
<p>Look madam  I cried to Catherine who was passing through the kitchen  That devil Heathcliff told you he could never love Miss Isabella And now he&#x27;s kissing her</p>
<p>Sohwhen Heathcliff entered the house Catherine was ready to scold him</p>
<p>Leave Isabella alone Heathcliff &#x27;she ordered  You&#x27;ll make Edgar angry</p>
<p>You think I&#x27;m afraid of that weak little creature  he growled  Anyway what difference does it make to you I can kiss her if she likes it I&#x27;m not your husband you needn&#x27;t be jealous of me</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not jealous of you &#x27;replied Catherine  If you like Isabella you can marry her But do you like her</p>
<p>It&#x27;s you I want to talk about Catherine You know you&#x27;ve treated me badly And I&#x27;m going to have my revenge Thank you for telling me Isabella&#x27;s secret I swear I&#x27;ll make good use of it</p>
<p>At this point I went to look for my master and told him that Catherine and Heathcliff were quarrelling in the kitchen</p>
<p>How can my wife call that man a friend  he cried angrily  I&#x27;ve been too weak with her I can&#x27;t allow him to visit her any more Call two servants Ellen  He went to the kitchen I followed him telling the servants to wait in the hall</p>
<p>Catherine &#x27;said Mr Edgar to his wife as he entered  Do you think it&#x27;s right to listen to this wicked man&#x27;s talk</p>
<p>Have you been listening at the door Edgar  asked Catherine coldly Heathcliff laughed which made Mr Edgar even angrier</p>
<p>You sir  he said to Heathcliff  are poisoning our family life I should never have accepted you as Catherine&#x27;s friend I must inform you that you will never be allowed to enter this house again and that if you don&#x27;t leave within three minutes you will be thrown out</p>
<p>Well well &#x27;replied Heathcliff looking scornfully at Mr Edgar&#x27;s small figure   So you&#x27;re going to throw me out your self are you</p>
<p>My master looked towards the door I realized he wanted to call the servants as he knew he was not strong enough to fight Heathcliff alone But Catherine must have guessed his plan She hurried to the door and locked it Mr Edgar looked at her in angry surprise</p>
<p>You must fight him like a gentleman without anyone to help you &#x27;she told her husband  That&#x27;ll teach you to scold me</p>
<p>Mr Edgar tried to get hold of the key but she threw it quickly into the hottest part of the fire He went very pale and could not stop his whole body trembling</p>
<p>Oh Edgar  cried his wife  You&#x27;ve lost the fight already You aren&#x27;t a man you&#x27;re a mouse</p>
<p>So that &#x27;said Heathcliff pointing at MrLEdgar  is the thing you preferred to me Catherine Is he crying or is he goingIto die of fear</p>
<p>He went up to look more closely at Mr Edgar who suddenly recovered and hit Heathcliff hard on the neck While Heath cliff was getting his breath back Mr Edgar walked out of the other kitchen door into the garden</p>
<p>Now you&#x27;ll never be able to come here again &#x27;said Cather ine to Heathcliff  Go away quickly He&#x27;ll return with men and guns</p>
<p>Heathcliff was sensible enough to take her advice He broke down the locked door and escaped just as the master and his men returned</p>
<p>Catherine who was over-excited ordered me to go upstairs with her I hoped she would not discover that I had told Mr Edgar about her quarrel with Heathcliff</p>
<p>I&#x27;m wild with anger Ellen &#x27;she said when we reached the sittingroom  All this trouble is because of Isabella Tell Edgar I&#x27;m in danger ofhbecoming seriously ill I hope it&#x27;s true I want to frighten him He&#x27;s upset me badly Why did he lis ten to us talking in the kitchen Heathcliff says wicked things but I know I can control him Well if I can&#x27;t have Heathcliff as my friend if Edgar is going to be mean and jealous I&#x27;ll try to break both their hearts by breaking my own You must re mind Edgar how quick-tempered I am and What Dr Kenneth said about my health Edgar must let me do what I want</p>
<p>I did not feel sympathetic towards Catherine and certainly did not want to frighten my poor master by telling him she was ill As I was leaving the room however he entered</p>
<p>Catherine  he said  you must tell me one thing You must choose between me and Heathcliff Which do you intend to have</p>
<p>Leave me alone &#x27;she cried wildly  I&#x27;m ill can&#x27;t you see I can&#x27;t even stand Edgar leave me</p>
<p>She fell stiff and pale on to the floor Mr Edgar looked very frightened</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry sir  I whispered to him  She told me she would try to make you afraid by pretending to be ill</p>
<p>Unfortunately she heard me She jumped up her hair loose and her eyes staring and rushed to her bedroom We heard the key turn in the lock</p>
<p>For the next few days she refused to speak to anyone even me I took her food up to her room but she would not eat Mr Edgar spent his time in the library and did not ask about his wife He hoped I suppose that she would come and ask him to forgive her But I knew she was too proud to do that</p>
<p>On the third day she unlocked her door and called me She ate and drank eagerly then lay down again</p>
<p>Oh why don&#x27;t I die since no one cares about me &#x27;she muttered  Edgar doesn&#x27;t love me at all What is he doing all this time Ellen</p>
<p>He&#x27;s reading Mbooks in the library madam  I answered</p>
<p>Reading books &#x27;she cried shocked  And I&#x27;m dying up here My God Does he know how I&#x27;ve changed how ill I am Can&#x27;t you tell him I&#x27;m seriously ill Ellen</p>
<p>You forget Mrs Linton that you&#x27;ve eaten tonight I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel better tomorrow morning  I still wanted to make her realize how selfish she was being although I was a little worried by her pale almost ghostly face</p>
<p>I begin to see that you don&#x27;t like me Ellen How strange I always thought everybody loved me Now they are all my enemies Isabella and Edgar and you I&#x27;ll die with cold faces around me I&#x27;ve had terrible dreams these past few nights you know Open the window Ellen I&#x27;m so hot</p>
<p>I refused as it was the middle of winter She was feverish</p>
<p>Who is that over there &#x27;she asked staring at her own face in a mirror opposite her bed I could not make her under stand it was herself and I began to be afraid that her illness was real</p>
<p>Stay with me Ellen &#x27;she cried holding my hand  I&#x27;m frightened of that face I&#x27;m frightened of being alone I wish I were in my bed at Wuthering Heights with the wind howling through the trees Do let me feel a breath of air from the moors just one breath</p>
<p>I opened the window for a moment then closed it The cold air seemed to calm her  I wish I were a young girl again wild and free out on the moors with Heathcliff Open the window again wider this time Why won&#x27;t you</p>
<p>Because I don&#x27;t want you to die of cold  I replied</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s my only chance of life &#x27;she cried jumping out of bed and going to the window I tried to force her back to bed but her fever made her surprisingly strong We looked out together into the icy darkness There was no moon and no lights were visible anywhere But Catherine was sure she could see Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>Look &#x27;she said  There&#x27;s my old home and the church yard near it I won&#x27;t lie there alone Heathcilff I won&#x27;t rest until you&#x27;re in the grave with me</p>
<p>I was still holding her back from the window and wondering what to do next when Mr Edgar entered</p>
<p>Please help sir  I called  Mrs Linton is ill</p>
<p>Catherine&#x27;s ill  he gasped  Shut the window Ellen Catherine Why</p>
<p>When he saw his wife&#x27;s face he was so shocked that he stopped speaking and stared at her in horror She was almost unconscious and did not recognize him at first</p>
<p>Ah it&#x27;s you is it Edgar Linton &#x27;she said after a few moments  You don&#x27;t come when you&#x27;re wanted and now you come when you&#x27;re not wanted But whatever you say nothing can keep me from my home my place of rest out there in the open air with a gravestone at my head</p>
<p>She&#x27;s feverish sir and doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s saying  I whispered  If she has food and rest she&#x27;ll recover</p>
<p>I want no further advice from you Ellen Dean &#x27;said Mr Edgar coldly  You knew how ill she was and you didn&#x27;t tell me</p>
<p>I ran downstairs and out of the kitchen door to fetch the doctor I thought I heard the sound of horses in the distance which seemed strange at two o clock in the morning And when I found Dr Kenneth he told me someone had seen Isabella and Heathcliff meeting secretly in the garden earlier that evening</p>
<p>That night none of us slept We all sat together and waited while the doctor stayed with his patient He told us he hoped that Catherine would recover if we kept her very quiet</p>
<p>In the morning we discovered that Isabella&#x27;s room was empty She had run away with Heathcliff When Mr Edgar heard the news he just said  She chose to go with him Don&#x27;t speak to me of her again I no longer think of her as my sister</p>
<p>9 Isabella&#x27;s story</p>
<p>1784 For two months we heard nothing of Isabella or Heathcliff During that time Catherine was dangerously ill with brain fever andhDr Kenneth warned us that even if she recovered her brain would never return to normal How ever she did seem to get better and no one could have been happier than my master when he saw her sitting up in bed for the first time and beginning to take an interest in the people and things around her He loved her so much and took such good care of her that I really thought she would recover There was another reason for her to live She was expecting a baby and we all hoped she would have a son who would inherit the Linton fortune</p>
<p>Then Mr Edgar received a letter from Isabella telling him that she and Heathcliff were married With it was a long letter for me which said</p>
<p>Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>Dear Ellen</p>
<p>I arrived here last night and heard that Catherine brother refuses to write to me so you are the only one I can write to Tell Edgar I still love him and Catherine and want to return to Thrushcross Grange but I can&#x27;t</p>
<p>The rest of this letter is for you alone Ellen Two questions how did you manage to get on with the people in this house Thay don&#x27;t seem human And this interests me very much what is Mr Heathcliff A man A madman A devil When you come to visit me you must explain to me what sort of creature I&#x27;ve married And you must come very soon with a message from Edgar</p>
<p>Heathcliff brought me here last night This house is going to be my home he says He disappeared as soon as we arrived so I entered the kitchen alone What a miserable depressing place it is now Ellen By the fire stood a dirty child I realized he must be Catherine&#x27;s nephew Hareton and tried to shake his hand But he greeted me by swearing at me so I went into the hall to find somebody else When I knocked at another door it was opened by a tall thin man with long dirty hair hanging down to his shoulders I knew this must be Hindley Earnshaw Catherine&#x27;s brother and Hareton&#x27;s father His eyes and Hareton&#x27;s reminded me of Catherine</p>
<p>What do you want  he asked roughly</p>
<p>My name was Isabella Linton  I replied  Now I&#x27;m married to Mr Heathcliff</p>
<p>Ah so that devil has returned Good  he growled</p>
<p>You can imagine Ellen how unhappy I felt in that unpleasant house I knew that only four miles away was my real home Thrushcross Grange containing the only people I loved in the world But those four miles were like an ocean which I could not cross Don&#x27;t tell Edgar or Catherine this but I had hoped to find a friend at Wuthering Heights some one to support me against Heathcliff Now I realized that no one here would help me</p>
<p>After a long silence I said  Please ask a maid to show me my bedroom I&#x27;m tired after my journey</p>
<p>We have no maids here  he answered  Joseph will show you Heathcliff&#x27;s room if you like And and you d better lock the bedroom door tonight</p>
<p>Why Mr Earnshaw  I asked I did not want to lock myself in with Heathcliff</p>
<p>He brought out a gun which had a knife attached to it</p>
<p>Look at this  he said  Every night I try to open his bed room door Up to now he&#x27;s locked it But one night he&#x27;ll forget and Then I&#x27;ll kill him</p>
<p>Why do you hate him so much  I asked</p>
<p>Because he&#x27;s taken everything from me  he shouted angrily  There&#x27;s nothing left for Hareton to inherit But I&#x27;m going to get it all back and his money too and then his blood Then the devil can have his soul</p>
<p>He seemed mad to me Ellen I left him and went to find the old servant Joseph It seemed that Heathcliff&#x27;s room was locked and there were no guest bedrooms so in the end I slept on a chair in the child&#x27;s room What a welcome to my new home</p>
<p>I know Heathcliff blames Edgar forQCatherine&#x27;s illness He has warned me he&#x27;ll make me suffer for it Oh I do hate him I&#x27;m so miserable I&#x27;ve been such a fool Don&#x27;t tell any one at Thrushcross Grange about this Ellen Come quickly don&#x27;t disappoint me</p>
<p>Isabella</p>
<p>As soon as I had read this I asked Mr Edgar if I could take a message from him to his sister</p>
<p>You may visit her this afternoon Ellen if you like Tell her I&#x27;m not angry just sorry to have lost her I can&#x27;t imagine she will ever be happy I shall never visit her or write to her</p>
<p>When I arrived at Wuthering Heights that afternoon I was shocked to see how much worse the house looked than when I used to live there I realized that Hindley did not care what conditions he lived in and Joseph clearly spent more time praying than cleaning Heathcliff and Isabella were both in the main room Heathcliff looked more like a gentleman than I had ever seen him but his wife had not bothered to brush her hair or change her dress I had to explain to poor Isabella that Mr Edgar had refused to write to her She cried a little when she heard that Then Heathcliff asked me question after question about Catherine&#x27;s illness</p>
<p>If you really love her  I told him  you&#x27;ll keep away from her now She mustn&#x27;t be over-excited Her health will always be weak And her loving husband is a very good nurse to her</p>
<p>Her loving husband &#x27;repeated Heathcliff scornfully  Don&#x27;t compare my feeling for her with his No Ellen before you leave this house I&#x27;ll make you promise to arrange a meet- ing for me with Catherine I must see her</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll never agree to that  I said  She&#x27;s just beginning to recover She&#x27;s almost forgotten you and now you want to upset her again    Ellen you know as well as I do that she can never forget me If she thinks once of Edgar Linton she thinks a thousand times of me He can&#x27;t love her as I can And Catherine has a heart as deep as mine</p>
<p>Catherine and Edgar are very fond of each other &#x27;said Isabella suddenly  Don&#x27;t speak of my brother like that</p>
<p>Your dear brother doesn&#x27;t care enough abut you to write to you &#x27;replied Heathcliff smiling sourly</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because be doesn&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;ve suffered &#x27;she answered quietly turning away to hide the tears on her face</p>
<p>Sir  I said  it seems to me that Miss Isabella Mrs Heathcliff I should say is unhappy You must treat her kindly Try to look after her Let her have a maid for example</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going to be soft with her  he repliedd with a laugh  She was stupid enough to run away with me I never pretended to love her Now I think she&#x27;s beginning to realize that I scorn her She&#x27;s an even weaker fool than her brother  but she&#x27;s going to be useful to me That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m keeping her with me     Ellen he says he married me to have his revenge on Edgar But I won&#x27;t let him carry out his plan whatever it is  I&#x27;ll die or I&#x27;ll see him dead first</p>
<p>You&#x27;re getting violent Isabella &#x27;said Heathcliff  Go up- stairs now I want to speak to Ellen Dean in private Go on   And he pushed her roughly out of the door    Don&#x27;t you feel pity for her  I asked when we were alone  Have you ever felt pity for anybody in your life    Why should I She&#x27;s just like an insect under my foot The more she cries the more I enjoy hurting her Now Ellen lis-ten I&#x27;ll wait every day and every evening in the Grange gar- den until I find a chance to see Catherine If I meet Edgar Linton or his servants I&#x27;ll shoot them But don&#x27;t you think it d be better to avoid a fight You could tell me when she&#x27;ll be alone Then there&#x27;ll be no violence</p>
<p>I argued and complained and refused fifty times but in the end he forced me to agree I promised to let him know when Edgar Linton was away from home I suppose it was wrong of me but I hoped it would be Heathcliff&#x27;s last meeting with Catherine</p>
<p>10 Heathcliff visits Catherine for the last time</p>
<p>1784 Heathcliff had given me a letter for Catherine but I decided not to show it to her until Mr Edgar was out of the house My chance came four days after my visit to Wuthering Heights As it was a Sunday Mr Edgar and all the servants went to church leaving me alone to look after Catherine</p>
<p>She was sitting downstairs by an open window enjoying the spring sunshine Her appearance had changed since her illness but there was a strange beauty in her pale face She did not read or sew any more but used to sit there silently  staring into the distance Her eyes seemed fixed on something far away something beyond normal sight</p>
<p>I showed her the letter but she looked confused and could not seem to understand it so I had to explain   It&#x27;s from Mr Heathcliff  I said gently  He&#x27;s in the garden and wants to see you What shall I tell him</p>
<p>She said nothing but bent forward in her chair to listen  We both heard someone coming through the hall Heathcliff had realized the house was almost empty and had found an open door Catherine looked eagerly towards the entrance to the room  He appeared and in two steps was by her side For five whole minutes he held her in his arms and kissed her again and again it gave him great pain to look at her face He could see as I could that she would never recover that she was certain to die</p>
<p>Oh Catherine Oh my life How can I bear It  he cried  You and Edgar have broken my heart &#x27;said Catherine   And you both want me to pity yoy How strong you are  Heathcliff You&#x27;ll live for years after my death Will you forget me and be happy with others when I&#x27;m in my grave   It&#x27;s wicked of you to say that Catherine You know your words will burn for ever in my memory after you&#x27;ve left me  You know I could never forget you</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want you to suffer more than I do Heathcliff I only want us to be together always</p>
<p>Heathcliff turned away his shoulders shaking    That isn&#x27;t my Heathcliff  Catherine said to me  I&#x27;ll always love my Heathcliff and take him with me He&#x27;s in my soul you see Oh Ellen I do want to escape from this prison There&#x27;s a beautiful world waiting for me out there You feel sorry for me now because I&#x27;m ill Well very soon I&#x27;ll feel sorry for you because I&#x27;ll be beyond you all</p>
<p>Heathcliff turned towards her his fierce eyes wet For a moment they looked at each other and then they were in each other&#x27;s arms again  No one could have separated them</p>
<p>How cruel you&#x27;ve been to me Catherine  he cried wildly   You loved me so why did you marry Edgar Linton It&#x27;s all your fault I haven&#x27;t broken your heart you&#x27;ve broken it  108 And you&#x27;ve broken mine too Do you think I want to live after you are dead     If I&#x27;ve done wrong I&#x27;m dying for it &#x27;sobbed Catherine   It&#x27;s your fault too Heathcliff You left me remember But I forgive you Now forgive me</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to forgive when I look at your sad eyes and feel your thin hands Kiss me again Catherine I forgive you for making me suffer but how can I forgive you for dying</p>
<p>Catherine sobbed quietly hiding her face in his shoulder  and tears rolled down Heathcliff&#x27;s dark face</p>
<p>Suddenly I noticed through the window the servants coming back from church I was afraid Mr Edgar would find Heathcliff with Catherine</p>
<p>My master will be here in a moment  I warned them    I must go Catherine &#x27;said Heathcliff   No no &#x27;she screamed Den&#x27;t go It&#x27;s the last time  Edgar won&#x27;t hurt us Heathcliff I&#x27;ll die if you go   All right my darling I&#x27;ll stay If he shot me in your arms I d die happy</p>
<p>At that moment my master appeared at the door When he saw Heathcliff holding his wife he went pale with anger</p>
<p>Here take care of her first &#x27;said Heathcliff putting Catherine in her husband&#x27;s arms  then speak to me later if you wish   He walked out of the house</p>
<p>Catherine seemed to be unconscious and Mr Edgar was so worried about her that he forgot about Heathcliff for the moment She recovered a little but did not recognize any of us and was clearly very ill We put her to bed immediately  and at twelve o clock that night her daughter Cathy was born two months early That&#x27;s the young lady you saw at Wuthering Heights Mr Lockwood Two hours later  Catherine died without calling for Heathcliff or recognizing Edgar My poor master was in the depths of despair I thought it was very unfortunate that Catherine had only given him a daughter not a son Now the Linton fortune would pass to Isabella and her husband after Mr Edgar&#x27;s death</p>
<p>Catherine&#x27;s dead body lay peacefully on her bed In death she looked more beautiful that in life I wondered if she was now beyond us all  as she had said and hoped that her soul had found a home with God</p>
<p>In the morning I went to look for Heathcliff I found him in the Grange garden where he had been waiting for news all night    She&#x27;s dead I know  he caned to me as I came closer</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t cry she doesn&#x27;t need your tears Tell me-tell me  how did-  He tried to say her name but could not manage it  How did she die  he said at last staring fiercely at me   Don&#x27;t be sorry for me I don&#x27;t want your pity    Poor creature  I thought  You have a heart just like other men but you are too proud to show it</p>
<p>Aloud I said  She died quietly in her sleep Her life finished in a gentle dream I hope she wakes as calmly in the other world    Where are you Catherine  he cried in despair  Don&#x27;t leave me here where I can&#x27;t find you I pray that you will never rest while I&#x27;m alive You said I killed you-haunt me then Murdered people do haunt their murderers I believe  Come back as a ghost-drive me mad-I don&#x27;t care Oh  God I can&#x27;t bear it I cannot live without you my soul</p>
<p>He howled like a wild animal and hit his forehead several times against a tree until the wood was covered in blood I knew I could no longer help him so I left him</p>
<p>Catherine was buried the following Friday Her brother Hindley although invited did not come and Isabella was not invited so it was only Mr Edgar and the servants who attended the ceremony  To our surprise she was not buried in the church with the Lintons nor with the Earnshaws She lies in an open corner of the churchyard where she can breather the air from the moors Her husband&#x27;s grave is next to hers</p>
<p>11 Isabella escapes</p>
<p>1784 That Friday evening the wind changed and brought first rain then snow Next morning the spring flowers were all hidden under deep snow Mr Edgar stayed in his room I was in the sitting-room with the baby when I was surprised to hear a girl&#x27;s voice behind me I turned round and saw it was Isabella Heathcliff I was quite shocked by her appearance Her hair was loose and wet with snow and rain  She wore a light silk dress and thin shoes which did not seem at all suitable for a long walk in the snow Under her ear was a deep wound which was bleeding Her face was scratched and bruised and she looked very tired I could see that she was expecting a baby</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve run all the way here from Wuthering Heights &#x27;she said gasping for breath  I couldn&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve fallen down Ellen please ask a maid to find some dry clothes for me and then I&#x27;ll go on to the village I&#x27;m not stay- ing here    First my dear young lady  I told her  you&#x27;ll get warm and dry and I&#x27;ll put a bandage on that wound Then we&#x27;ll have some tea  She was so exhausted that she let me help her without protesting and finally we sat down together near the fire with our cups of tea</p>
<p>Oh Ellen &#x27;she said  I cried bitterly when I heard of Catherine&#x27;s death you know And Heathcliff is desperately sad But I can&#x27;t feel sorry for him This is the last thing of his I&#x27;ve got  and she took off her gold wedding-ring and threw it in the fire  I&#x27;ll never go back to him But I can&#x27;t stay here  in case he comes to find me And anyway I don&#x27;t want to beg for Edgar&#x27;s help or make trouble for him To escape from Heathcliff I must go a long way away How could Catherine have liked him Ellen I wish he would die and then I could forget him completely     Don&#x27;t say that  I protested  he&#x27;s a human being There are worse men than him in the world     He isn&#x27;t human &#x27;she replied  I gave him my heart and he destroyed it so I can&#x27;t feel pity for him But I must tell you how I managed to escape Hindley Earnshaw should have been at Catherine&#x27;s burial yesterday but he had been drinking so much that he couldn&#x27;t go Last night he and I were sitting silently in the kitchen at about midnight when Heathcliff came home Hindley decided to lock the doors so that Heath- cliff could not get in He told me his plan was to murder his hated guest that night with the weapon he had shown me I hate Heathcliff too but I could not agree to murder so I called out a warning from the kitchen window Heathcliff swore horribly at me and broke one of the windows Hindley put his right arm out through the hole with the gun in it and aimed it at his enemy But before he could fire Heathcliff caught hold of the gun and pulled it away from Hindley The knife cut into Hindley&#x27;s wrist and blood poured out Heath- cliff jumped into the kitchen through the window and started kicking and hitting Hindley who was lying unconscious on the kitchen floor    I ran off to find Joseph When we came back Heathcliff was putting a bandage on Hindley&#x27;s wrist Joseph was shocked at the sight of his master and would have gone to the police  if Heathcliff hadn&#x27;t forced me to describe what happened I had to agree that Hindley had certainly attacked Heathcliff first    The next day I decided to have my revenge on Heathcliff  by telling Hindley that that devil had hit and kicked him when he was unconscious And I told Heathcliff to his face that he could never have made Catherine happy if she had been his wife This made him so angry that he threw a knife at me which cut my neck and then he rushed towards me  swearing violently I knew I had to get away quickly and as I ran out of the kitchen I saw Hindley attack Heathcliff Both of them were rolling on the floor fighting I came over the moors through the snow to the Grange At last I&#x27;m free And I shall never never spend another night at Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>After drinking her tea Isabella left the Grange From our village she travelled by coach to the south where she made her new home near London There a few months later she had a son She called him Linton</p>
<p>Heathcliff must have discovered this from the servants One day when I saw him in the village he said  I hear I&#x27;ve got a son Ellen whose name&#x27;s Linton I suppose Isabella wants me to hate him She can keep him for the moment But tell Edgar Linton I&#x27;ll have the boy one day He&#x27;s mine</p>
<p>After Catherine&#x27;s death my poor master Mr Edgar was a changed man He no longer went to church or saw any friends He occasionally went for lonely walks on the moors  and regularly visited his wife&#x27;s grave But fortunately Catherine had left him something of herself her daughter Cathy This tiny child soon won his heart</p>
<p>It&#x27;s strange Mr Lockwood to compare Hindley and Edgar They both lost their wives and were left with a child  Hindley did not believe in God and showed no interest in his son Hareton But Edgar believed and loved his daughter Cathy deeply</p>
<p>Hindley himself died six months after his sister Catherine  We never discovered exactly what happened but Heathcliff said he had drunk himself to death It appeared that Heathcliff had won Hindley&#x27;s house land and money from him when playing cards so he was now the master of Wuthering Heights Hareton inherited nothing from his father and could only stay on at Wuthering Heights as a servant working for the man who had been his father&#x27;s enemy</p>
<p>12 Bringing up Cathy</p>
<p>1797 During the next twelve years I was happier than I had ever been before All my time was spent looking after little Cathy who brought sunshine into our lives She was a real beauty with the Earnshaws  dark eyes and the Lintons fair skin She wasn&#x27;t as proud and quick-tempered as her mother but she was used to getting what she wanted  Her father loved her so much that he gave her everything and never scolded her</p>
<p>Until she was thirteen she had never been outside the Grange garden alone She knew nothing of Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff She often asked me about the hills in the distance beyond the moors and wanted to ride her pony there I knew the master would not let her leave the safety of the Grange to go so far especially as the road to the hills passed close to Wuthering Heights So I always told her she would be able to go there when she was older I did not know what she was planning</p>
<p>Mr Edgar received a letter from his sister Isabella She wrote that she was dying of a fever and asked him to visit her for the first and last time She also wanted him to take care of her son Linton after her death Although my master hated travelling he did not hesitate to do as she requested He told me to look after Cathy carefully and left at once</p>
<p>He was away for three weeks Cathy did not cause me any trouble at first She spent her days walking her dogs and riding her pony in the large garden But one day she asked if she could stay out the whole day and away she went on her little pony with her two dogs running behind</p>
<p>There was no sign of her at tea-time and I began to be seriously worried I went outside to look for her At the gate I found a workman who had seen-her jump the low wall separating the garden from the road and then ride on towards the hills and Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>I was very frightened now She could be lost on the moors  She could have tried to climb the hills and fallen I walked across the moors as fast as I could and arrived breathless at Wuthering Heights How glad I was to see one of her dogs lying outside the kitchen door I knocked loudly and Zillah let me in I knew she had been the housekeeper there since Hindley&#x27;s death    Ah &#x27;she said  you&#x27;ve come for your little mistress She&#x27;s here quite safe The master Mr Heathcliff isn&#x27;t here He won&#x27;t be back for a while</p>
<p>Cathy was sitting comfortably in the kitchen talking eagerly to Hareton He was now a big strong young man of eighteen who was staring rather stupidly at her I was delighted to find her again but I pretended to be angry to punish her    Well miss You are wicked going such a long way all alone I&#x27;ve been all over the moors looking for you looking father will be angry     What have I done &#x27;she sobbed suddenly frightened   Father didn&#x27;t forbid me to leave the Grange garden He won&#x27;t scold me Ellen He&#x27;s never cross like you And I&#x27;ve been to the hills Ellen This-man-showed me because I didn&#x27;t know the way</p>
<p>I made her put on her hat and prepare to leave   Whose house is this &#x27;she asked suddenly  It&#x27;s your father&#x27;s isn&#x27;t it &#x27;she added turming to Hareton    No  he replied looking down His face went very red</p>
<p>Whose then-your master&#x27;s &#x27;she asked</p>
<p>He swore and turned away   Ellen he didn&#x27;t say miss to me Servants should always say  miss  shouldn&#x27;t they</p>
<p>Hareton frowned and looked very angry but said nothing    You get my horse &#x27;she ordered him  Hurry     What the devil do you mean I&#x27;m not your servant  he growled    You see Miss Cathy Nice words to be used to a young lady Now come along let&#x27;s fetch the pony and leave  I said    But Ellen &#x27;she cried staring horrified at him  how dare he speak to me like that He must do as I tell him</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not your servant miss &#x27;said Zillah who had been listening to the conversation  He&#x27;s your cousin    He can&#x27;t be my cousin  cried Cathy with a scornful  laugh  Father has gone to fetch my cousin from London He&#x27;s a gentleman&#x27;s son not-not a farm worker like him  She pointed at poor Hareton whose clothes were old and dirty</p>
<p>I was very annoyed with her and Zillah Now Heathcliff would hear about his son&#x27;s arrival which we had hoped to keep secret from him And Cathy would certainly ask her father whether she had a cousin at Wuthering Heights On our way home I explained to her that if her father discovered she had visited Wuthering Heights he would perhaps be so angry with me that he would send me away She could not bear to think of that so she promised to keep her visit a secret from him</p>
<p>We heard from Mr Edgar that his sister had died and that he was returning soon with his young nephew Cathy was wild with excitement She would see her dear father again and have a cousin of the same age to play with</p>
<p>But when the coach arrived young Linton had to be carried into the house He was a pale thin boy who looked very like Mr Edgar He seemed so weak that I wondered how long he would live I thought he would have no chance of life if his father Heathcliff took him to live at Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>In fact Linton only stayed one night with us Later that evening Heathcliff&#x27;s servant Joseph arrived and asked to speak to the master Although it was late and Mr Edgar was tired after his journey Joseph insisted so I took him to the master&#x27;s room    Heathcliff has sent me for his son and I can&#x27;t go back without him  he said</p>
<p>Mr Edgar was silent for a moment On his face was an expression of deep sadness He had hoped to keep Linton with him as Isabella had wished But he could not refuse the boy&#x27;s father   Tell Mr Heathcliff  he said calmly  that Ellen will take his son to Wuthering Heights tomorrow He s asleep at the moment and I won&#x27;t disturb him</p>
<p>No &#x27;said Joseph banging the table with his hand  I must take him back now</p>
<p>Not tonight  answered Mr Edgar  Leave the house now and tell your master what I said     Very well &#x27;shouted Joseph as he walked out  If he doesn&#x27;t arrive early in the morning Heathcliff will come for him</p>
<p>13 Heathcliff&#x27;s son at Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>1797 Linton was very surprised to be woken so early and told that he had another journey to make before break fast As we rode the four miles to Wuthering Heights he kept asking me questions abut his new home and the father he had never seen When we arrived Heathcliff Hareton and Joseph all came out of the house to inspect the child</p>
<p>Master that&#x27;s not a boy &#x27;said Joseph after a while    Look at that white skin and fair hair Mr Edgar&#x27;s sent you his daughter instead    God What a beautiful creature  laughed Heathcliff scornfully  That&#x27;s worse than I expected</p>
<p>I helped the trembling child off the horse and into the house Heathcliff took him roughly by the arm</p>
<p>I hope you&#x27;ll be kind to him Mr Heathcliff  I said  He&#x27;s weak and ill And he&#x27;s all the family you&#x27;ve go</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry  Ellen &#x27;replied Heathcliff with a smile  As Isabella&#x27;s son he&#x27;ll inherit Thrushcross Grange one day and I don&#x27;t want him to die before that He&#x27;ll be educated as a gentleman But I&#x27;m bitterly disappointed at having such a weak crying baby for a son</p>
<p>So poor Linton was left in his father&#x27;s care At first Cathy was miserable because she would not now have anyone to play with but she soon forgot him Whenever I met Zillah the housekeeper in the village I used to ask her abut Linton    He&#x27;s often ill &#x27;she told me  And so selfish He has to have a fire even in summer He calls for cakes and hot drinks all the time He only ever thinks of himself Mr Heathcliff can&#x27;t bear being in the same room as him</p>
<p>Several years passed without any more news of Linton In 1800 Cathy reached the age of sixteen We never celebrated her birthday because it was also the day her mother died On this particular day she came downstairs dressed for going out and suggested a walk on the moors with me Her father gave permission</p>
<p>It was a lovely spring morning and I was very happy walking in the sunshine watching Cathy running ahead of me But we had walked further than I had realized and I called to her to come back She did not seem to hear me  We were on the moors close to Wuthering Heights when I caught sight of two men talking to her I recognized Heathcliff and Hareton at once I hurried to catch up with her    Miss Cathy  I said breathlessly  we must go home  Your father will be getting worried   No he won&#x27;t Ellen This gentleman wants me to go to his house and meet his son He says we&#x27;ve already met but I don&#x27;t remember do you Let&#x27;s go Ellen</p>
<p>Although I protested she and Hareton were already halfway to Wuthering Heights Heathcliff and I followed behind    It&#x27;s very bad of you Mr Heathcliff  I scolded him  Mr Edgar will blame me for letting her go to your house     I want her to see Linton Ellke  he re led  Listen to my plan It&#x27;s really a very generous one I want the two cousins to fall in love and marry You know Cathy won&#x27;t inherit anything from her father My son Linton will inherit all the Linton fortune when Edgar dies If she marries Linton  she&#x27;ll be wealthy Of course if Linton dies then the money comes to me as his only other relation</p>
<p>I was still angry with Heathcliff but it was too late to stop Cathy entering Wuthering Heights She was delighted to rediscover her cousin Linton who was keeping warm by the fire    If he is my cousin and you are his father &#x27;she said to Heathcliff smiling  then you must be my uncle Why don&#x27;t you ever visit us at the Grange    I visited it once or twice too often before you were born   he said  I must tell you that I quarrelled violently with your father once He hates me and if you tell him you want to come here he&#x27;ll forbid it</p>
<p>Well  if I can&#x27;t come here  Linton can come to visit me at the Grange  suggested Cathy happily</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be too far for me   said her cousin weakly  It would kill me to walk four miles</p>
<p>Heathcliff looked scornfully at his son</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think my plan will ever succeed  Ellen  he whispered to me  Who would fall in love with a selfish baby  138like that   He went to the kitchen door and called  Hareton Come and take Miss Cathy round the farm   Cathy was eager to see the animals  and she and Hareton went out</p>
<p>As we watched them through the kitchen window Heathcliff seemed to be thinking aloud</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve taken my revenge on his father  by making Hareton work for me  I treat him badly  as they used to do to me  and he suffers  as I used to  He&#x27;s intelligent  and strong  and handsome  but I&#x27;ve taught him to scorn those qualities  So now he&#x27;s just an uneducated farm worker and knows nothing of the world That&#x27;s how he&#x27;ll always be And my son He&#x27;s stupid and weak and ill But he&#x27;s gentleman and he&#x27;ll mar- ry Cathy and he&#x27;ll be rich</p>
<p>Meanwhile Linton had got up from his armchair and gone out to join Cathy and Hareton Through the open window I could hear the two younger ones laughing at Hareton&#x27;s coarse way of speaking I began to disliker Linton rather than pity him</p>
<p>When we arrived back at the Grange Cathy told her fathter about the visit He did not want to frighten her and in my opinion did not explain clearly enough why she should never communicate with Linton again At the time she seemed to accept her father&#x27;s wish</p>
<p>During the next few weeks however I noticed Cathy&#x27;s behaviour change She was always writing on little pieces of paper which she kept in a locked drawer in her room and every morning she got up surprisingly early to go down to the kitchen I suspected something and day I decided to break open her drawer In it I was horrified to find a whole pile of love letters from Linton The two cousins had been writing to each other in secret for several weeks and Cathy had used the milkman as a messenger I told her at once that I knew her secret and made her promise not to send or receive any more letters We burnt Linton&#x27;s letters together</p>
<p>14 Secret visits</p>
<p>1800 The months passed and soon it was autumn Mr Edgar caught a bad cold which seemed to get worse and worse He stayed indoors the whole winter so Cathy only had me as a companion on her walks She had become very quiet and sad since her relationship with Linton had ended and was very worried about her father&#x27;s illness One day when we were walking in the Grange garden I noticed her crying    Cathy what&#x27;s the matter love  I ashed    Oh Ellen &#x27;she sobbed  what shall I do if Father dies  And if you die I&#x27;ll be left alone     I hope he and I have years more of life ahead of us All you need do is look after your father and let him see you&#x27;re cheerful But I think he would be really ill if he thought you loved Linton whose father would like to see Mr Edgar dead</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll never never do anything to worry or annoy Father &#x27;she promised  I only want him to recover I love him more than anyone else in the world more than myself</p>
<p>Just then we reached the gate and I saw a gentleman on a horse looking over it It was Heathcliff    Miss Linton  he called There&#x27;s something I must tell you</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t listen answered Cathy  Father and Ellen both say you&#x27;re a wicked man</p>
<p>But this is about my son Linton not me What a trick you played on him You wrote him all those love letters and then I suppose you got tired of it and stopped well you&#x27;ve broken poor Linton&#x27;s heart I swear he&#x27;s dying of love for you and he&#x27;ll be in the grave by next summer unless you help him Be generous come and visit him I&#x27;ll be away all next week so your father won&#x27;t be angry if you come</p>
<p>He rode away Although I tried to persuade Cathy that Heathcliff could not be telling the truth my young mistress was very upset and determined to discover how Linton was</p>
<p>The next morning we rode to Wuthering Heights We found Linton alone lying on a sofa He looked feverish and ill and had a bad cough    Will you shut the door  he said crossly as we entered   It&#x27;s so cold No Cathy I can&#x27;t breathe if you kiss me I want a drink</p>
<p>Cathy poured him a glass of water</p>
<p>And are you glad to see me Linton &#x27;she asked hopefully    Yes I am  he replied  But you should have come before My father swore at me and said it was my fault you didn&#x27;t come Will you come and visit me again    Yes Linton  Cathy said gently holding his hand  If Father agreed I d spend half my time with you I wish you were my brother then we could spend all our time together     But my father says you would love me best if you were my wife so that would be better</p>
<p>I d never love anybody more than Father &#x27;she replied seriously  Sometimes men hate their wives like your father  He hated your mother my aunt Isabella That&#x27;s why she left him     That&#x27;s not true  cried the boy  Anyway your mother hated your father And she loved mine    You&#x27;re lying I hate you &#x27;she shouted angrily and gave the sofa a violent push He fell back and started coughing so badly that even I was frightened At last he recovered Cathy was crying in a comer afraid that she had really hurt him</p>
<p>How do you feel now Linton &#x27;she asked after a while   I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t mean to hurt you    I wish you felt as ill as I do you cruel thing And I was better today before you came  His voice was full of pity for himself</p>
<p>We must go  I said  You can soe Miss Cathy that he isn&#x27;t dying of love for you It&#x27;s not your fault that he&#x27;s ill  Come along  But I could not stop Cathy whispering some- thing in Linton&#x27;s ear before we left the room</p>
<p>On the way home I told her I would not allow her to visit him again    He&#x27;s a selfish child Miss Cathy and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll live till he&#x27;s twenty I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re not going to marry him</p>
<p>Cathy looked sad  I&#x27;m sure he d recover if I looked after him And I don&#x27;t think we d quarrel if we knew each other better   148  Well miss if you try to go there again with or without me I&#x27;ll tell your father</p>
<p>But the next day I fell ill and had to stay in bed for three weeks which was very unusual for me My little mistress went from her father&#x27;s bedroom to mine and back again and looked after us both with the greatest care But I never wondered what she did in the evenings when Mr Edgar had gone to bed and I no longer needed her</p>
<p>I only discovered the truth on the first day I was able to get up In the evening I asked her to read to me and was surprised how sleepy she seemed She went to bed early I felt rather worried about her health and went to her room an hour later to see if she needed anything Her bedroom was empty I sat there in the dark waiting for her to return</p>
<p>when she arrived shaking the snow off her shoes she was shocked to find me there I guessed where she had been but I made her tell me the whole story Every night since I had been ill she had ridden to Wuthering Heights and spent the evening with her cousin Sometimes she was happy with Linton when he was cheerful and less selfish but most of the time she was miserable However she insisted that the visits should continue because Linton needed her and she wanted to see him</p>
<p>Although she begged me to say nothing to her father I went straight to the master and told him He forbade her to visit Wuthering Heights again She had to obey her father  although it made her very sad</p>
<p>Well Mr Lockwood all this happened only about a year ago I never thought I would be telling a stranger this story But who knows how long you&#x27;ll be a stranger You&#x27;re too young to live alone for long and no one could see Cathy and not love her Anyway I&#x27;ll continue my story</p>
<p>15 A trap</p>
<p>1800 A few days after the master had forbidden Cathy to visit Linton he asked my opinion of the boy</p>
<p>Tell me honestly Ellen what do you think of his character</p>
<p>Well sir I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s wicked like his father But you&#x27;ll have plenty of time to get to know him sir He&#x27;s too young to marry yet</p>
<p>Mr Edgar walked to the window and looked out It was a misty February evening but the churchyard was just visible</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve often prayed for death Ellen I&#x27;ve been very happy with my little Cathy But I&#x27;ve been just as happy lying through the long June evenings on her mother&#x27;s grave and looking forward to the moment when I can join Catherine there I haven&#x27;t got much time left Ellen What can I do for Cathy before I die Should she marry Linton I wouldn&#x27;t mind him being Heathcliff&#x27;s son if only he loved her and could be a good husband to her</p>
<p>God will show us what to do sir  I replied</p>
<p>In the spring Mr Edgar was still ill and he continued to worry about Cathy&#x27;s future One day he wrote to Linton inviting him to visit the Grange Linton wrote a long letter back explaining that his father would not allow him to do that He begged his uncle to let him meet Cathy for a walk or a ride on the moors between the Grange and Wuthering Heights as they could not meet in either house Mr Edgar refused at first and Linton sent him several more letters I am sure they had all been carefully checked by Heathcliff before they were posted</p>
<p>Finally Mr Edgar agreed He hoped that if Cathy married Linton who would inherit the Linton fortune she would at least be able to remain in her family home He had no idea that Linton was seriously ill Neither did I I never imagined that a father could treat a dying child as cruelly and wickedly as we later discovered Heathcliff had done</p>
<p>It was a hot sunny day in summer when Cathy and I rode out to meet her cousin We were both shocked to discover that he could neither ride nor walk and was lying on the grass waiting for us He looked even paler and weaker than the last time I had seen him During our meeting he did not seem interested in Cathy or her news Cathy noticed this immediately</p>
<p>Well Linton &#x27;she said after a while  you don&#x27;t want to talk to me so I think I&#x27;ll go home</p>
<p>No no  he cried getting quite excited  Not yet Stay at least another half-hour My father will be angry with me if you leave early</p>
<p>I suppose we can stay a few minutes longer &#x27;said Cathy</p>
<p>We waited talking to each other quietly while Linton slept a little Sometimes he cried out in pain   Do you think his health is better now than before  whispered Cathy</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry Miss Cathy I think it&#x27;s much worse  I answered</p>
<p>Cathy called her pony and the sound woke Linton up</p>
<p>If you see my father  he said hesitating  could you tell him I&#x27;ve been cheerful He&#x27;ll be here soon  And he looked round in terror</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be here next Thursday  cried Cathy as she jumped on her pony  Come on Ellen</p>
<p>In the week that followed Mr Edgar&#x27;s illness grew worse every day Cathy could not avoid realizing how serious it was and sat by his bedside day and night looking sad and pale Her father&#x27;s room had become her whole world On Thursday I thought a ride in the fresh air would be good for her and Mr Edgar gladly gave her permission to see Linton He was hoping that she would not be left alone after his death I did not want to worry him in his last moments so I did not tell him that Linton was also dying</p>
<p>We rode on to the moors and found Linton lying in the same place as before He was looking very frightened</p>
<p>I thought you weren&#x27;t going to come  he said</p>
<p>Why won&#x27;t you be honest  cried Cathy at once  Why have you brought me here again if you don&#x27;t want to see me My father&#x27;s very ill and I should be with him</p>
<p>Tears rolled down Linton&#x27;s face He seemed terrified</p>
<p>Oh I can&#x27;t bear it  he sobbed  Cathy I daren&#x27;t explain But if you leave me he&#x27;ll kill me Dear Cathy my life is in your hands Kind sweet Cathy perhaps you will agree and then he won&#x27;t hurt me</p>
<p>Cathy was no longer impatient  Agree to what Linton &#x27;she asked gently  Tell me everything You wouldn&#x27;t do anything to hurt me would you Linton I&#x27;m your best friend</p>
<p>I daren&#x27;t tell you My father &#x27;the boy gasped Just then Heathcliff appeared He did not look at Cathy and Linton who continued talking to each other but he spoke quietly to me</p>
<p>Ellen how is Edgar Is he dying as the villagers say</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true the master is dying  I answered</p>
<p>That boy over there is dying too I only hope Edgar dies before him If Linton dies first my plan will fail  He shouted angrily to his son  Get up Linton  and then said politely to Cathy  Miss Cathy would you help him back to the house He can&#x27;t walk far alone</p>
<p>Father has forbidden me to enter your house &#x27;said Cathy</p>
<p>Well come along Linton I&#x27;ll have to take you home then &#x27;said Heathcliff</p>
<p>No No No Please Cathy You must come with me &#x27;screamed Linton wildly He held desperately on to her arm</p>
<p>Cathy could not refuse the boy who seemed almost mad with fear So we all walked the few steps to Wuthering Heights When we had entered the house however I was horrified to see Heathcliff lock the front door The key was in his hand</p>
<p>Hareton Joseph and Zillah are all out of the house  he said calmly  so we are quite alone</p>
<p>Give me that key  cried Cathy angrily  I&#x27;m not afraid of you  She took hold of his closed hand and bit it He hit her violently several times on both sides of the head and she fell into a chair trembling I rushed at him but he pushed me away</p>
<p>Cry as much as you like Miss Cathy  he said  In a few days I&#x27;ll be your father and I&#x27;ll punish you just like that as often as necessary</p>
<p>When Heathcliff went out to look for our horses Cathy and I hurried round the kitchen looking for a way to escape But all the doors and windows were locked Linton was sitting calmly in a chair near the fire happy that he was not being punished this time We persuaded him to explain his father&#x27;s plan to us</p>
<p>Father is afraid I&#x27;ll die soon you see so he wants us to be married tomorrow morning You&#x27;ll have to stay here all night Cathy Then perhaps he&#x27;ll let you go home in the morning</p>
<p>You marry this beautiful healthy young lady  I cried  You must be mad And wicked too You and your father have tricked us into coming here  And I shook him until he started coughing</p>
<p>I must go home now Father will be worried already &#x27;said Cathy  I love Father better than you Linton</p>
<p>Heathcliff returned and sent his son upstairs to bed</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff  begged Cathy  Father will be miserable if I don&#x27;t go home Please let me go I promise to marry Linton Father would like it and I love him Why do you force me to do something I want to do</p>
<p>He can&#x27;t force you  I cried  I&#x27;ll go to the police</p>
<p>To the devil with you Ellen Miss Cathy I&#x27;m delighted that your father will be miserable In that case you will certainly stay here for twenty-four hours You won&#x27;t leave here until you&#x27;ve kept your promise to marry Linton</p>
<p>Please send Ellen to let Father know I&#x27;m safe &#x27;sobbed Cathy bitterly  Poor Father He&#x27;ll think we&#x27;re lost</p>
<p>Your father must have hated you when you came into the world I did at least  and he&#x27;ll hate you as he leaves it Go on crying That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll be doing when you&#x27;re Linton&#x27;s wife He&#x27;ll make a cruel selfish husband I think</p>
<p>Heathcliff took us upstairs to Zillah&#x27;s room where we spent the night locked in Neither of us could sleep At seven the following morning he came to fetch Cathy and took her away From that moment I saw nobody except Hareton who brought me food for four whole days and nights</p>
<p>On the fifth morning Zillah came into the room She was surprised and pleased to see me and told me the villagers all thought Cathy and I had got lost on the moors and died four days ago I ran out of the room to look for Cathy</p>
<p>The big kitchen was full of sunshine and the door was open but the only person there was Linton</p>
<p>Where is she Where is Miss Cathy  I cried wildly</p>
<p>Upstairs in a locked room  he replied calmly eating a piece of sugar  We won&#x27;t let her go yet Father says I shouldn&#x27;t he soft with Cathy We&#x27;ve had the wedding ceremony so she&#x27;s my wife now and must stay with me I don&#x27;t care if she cries or is ill</p>
<p>Have you forgotten her kindness to you last winter when you wrote that you loved her and she used to come through wind and snow to see you Now you believe your father&#x27;s lies about her And you leave her alone ill and crying in a strange house You pity yourself but you won&#x27;t pity her What a heartless selfish boy you are</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t stay with her She cries so much I can&#x27;t bear it I can&#x27;t sleep with all that noise She promised that if I gave her the key to our room she d give me all her nice books and her pony but I told her she had nothing to give They&#x27;re all mine or they&#x27;ll belong to me very soon And then she cried and took a little gold case from around her neck Inside were two pictures one of her mother and one of her father I wanted to take them both from her but she wouldn&#x27;t let me so I screamed for help My father came and ordered her to give him the pictures and the case When she refused he he hit her on the face and knocked her down and broke the gold case under his foot He took away the picture of her mother</p>
<p>And were you pleased to see Miss Cathy hurt  I asked</p>
<p>My father was right to punish her But I didn&#x27;t like seeing her mouth full of blood She can&#x27;t speak because of the pain Now you&#x27;ve made me tired with all this talking You won&#x27;t find the key to the room Go away</p>
<p>As there seemed to be no chance of persuading him to help her escape I decided to go back to the Grange as quickly as possible and rescue her later</p>
<p>What a welcome I received from the servants at the Grange who thought I was dead But I did not have time to tell them my story I went straight to my master&#x27;s room He was lying in bed very weak and close to death I told him how Heathcliff had trapped us and that Cathy was probably mar ried to Linton by now Mr Edgar realized that his enemy wanted to get hold of the Linton fortune through his son He asked me to send for his lawyer to make arrangements so that Cathy would not lose all her inheritance</p>
<p>I did as he asked but the lawyer sent a message saying that he could not come until the next day I also sent four strong men with weapons to Wuthering Heights to demand my young lady&#x27;s freedom I was very angry when they returned without her because Heathcliff had sent them away</p>
<p>But I needn&#x27;t have worried In the middle of the night as I was taking some water to the master I heard a knock on the front door and went to open it It was my little mistress</p>
<p>Ellen Ellen &#x27;she sobbed  Is Father still alive</p>
<p>Yes  I cried  and thank God you&#x27;re safe with us again</p>
<p>I managed to make Linton help me escape from the room Now I must see Father</p>
<p>I could not bear to be present at their meeting I waited outside the bedroom door But they were both calm Cathy&#x27;s despair was as silent as her father&#x27;s happiness He died in perfect peace Mr Lockwood Kissing her he whispered  I&#x27;m going to join her and you dear child will join us  He did not move or speak again</p>
<p>Cathy did not cry but sat silently by his dead body all morning At lunch-time the lawyer arrived too late to help Cathy Heathcliff had bribed him to stay away He gave us Heathcliff&#x27;s orders All the servants except me had to leave Cathy Mrs Heathcliff now was only allowed to stay at the Grange until her father was buried</p>
<p>16 Cathy becomes a widow</p>
<p>1800 1 On the evening after the burial Heathcliff came to fetch Cathy</p>
<p>Why not let her stay here with me  I begged</p>
<p>I&#x27;m looking for someone to rent the Grange from me  he answered  You&#x27;ll stay on here as housekeeper Ellen but Cathy must come to Wuthering Heights From now on she&#x27;ll have to work for her food</p>
<p>I shall work &#x27;replied Cathy  And I&#x27;ll look after Linton He&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to love in the world I&#x27;m just sorry for you Mr Heathcliff You have nobody to love you You are as lonely and miserable as the devil Nobody will cry for you when you die I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not you</p>
<p>Go and get your clothes you wicked girl  he said  We&#x27;ll be leaving in a few minutes  When she had gone he walked across the room to look at the picture of Cathy&#x27;s mother Catherine which was hanging on the wall</p>
<p>Do you know what I did yesterday Ellen  he said turning quickly away from the picture  I went to the churchyard and asked the man who was digging Edgar&#x27;s grave to open the lid of Catherine&#x27;s coffin for me Her face looked just the same I could not stop looking at her When the man closed the lid I broke open one side of her coffin the side away from Edgar&#x27;s grave and covered it up with earth And I bribed the man to bury me there when I die next to her and to take the side of my coffin away too so that I shall have her in my arms not Edgar</p>
<p>You were very wicked Mr Heathcliff to disturb the dead</p>
<p>I disturbed nobody Ellen and I feel much happier now She is the one who has disturbed me For eighteen years she has haunted me You know I was wild almost mad after she died For days I prayed for her ghost to return to me On the day of her burial I went to her grave in the evening There was a bitter wind and snow on the ground I wanted so much to have her in my arms again So I dug down through the loose earth to her coffin and was about to pull the lid off when I felt a warm breath on my face She seemed to be with me not in the earth but close to me I was so happy that she was with me again I filled in the grave and ran eagerly home to the Heights I looked impatiently round for her I could feel her but I could not see her And since then she has played plenty of tricks on me like that When I sleep in her bedroom I can hear her outside the window or entering the room or even breathing close to me but when I open my eyes I&#x27;m always disappointed Slowly slowly she&#x27;s killing me with the ghost of a hope that&#x27;s lasted eighteen years</p>
<p>He was talking almost to himself so I did not answer When Cathy came in he stood up ready to go</p>
<p>Goodbye Ellen  whispered my dear little mistress  Come and visit me  As she kissed me her face felt as cold as ice</p>
<p>Oh no you won&#x27;t Ellen &#x27;said Heathcliff  I&#x27;ll send for you if I want you  and together they left the Grange</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t seen Cathy since then Once I went to the Heights to visit her but I was not allowed to see her About six weeks ago I had a long conversation with Zillah the housekeeper who gave me news of Cathy It appeared that when she ar rived at the Heights she did her best to look after her sick husband He was obviously dying although Heathcliff refused to call the doctor Only a few weeks after her arrival Linton died in the night with only Cathy by his bedside Heathcliff inherited all of Linton&#x27;s and what had been Cathy&#x27;s fortune so Cathy is now very poor</p>
<p>She must be very miserable and very lonely in that dark unpleasant house Heathcliff hates her and Joseph and Zillah don&#x27;t speak to her because they think she&#x27;s too proud Poor Hareton would like to be friendly with her but she scorns him because he&#x27;s uneducated I would like to leave my job here rent a little cottage and ask Cathy to come and live with me but Mr Heathcliff will never permit that Of course if she married again she could leave that house but I can&#x27;t arrange that</p>
<p>17 Mr Lockwood visits Wuthering Heights again</p>
<p>1802 After hearing the end of Mrs Dean&#x27;s story I made my plans for the future I decided I did not want to spend another winter at the Grange and told her I would ride to the Heights to inform my landlord She handed me a letter to give to Cathy Heathcliff</p>
<p>When I arrived at the gate Hareton met me and took me into the house Cathy was there preparing vegetables for lunch She did not bother to greet me</p>
<p>She may be beautiful  I thought  but she&#x27;s not very polite  I passed by her chair and cleverly dropped Mrs Dean&#x27;s note in front of her so that Hareton wouldn&#x27;t see it She however just said aloud  What&#x27;s that</p>
<p>A letter from the housekeeper at the Grange  I said annoyed with her She gasped and tried to pick it up but Hareton got there first</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff will want to look at this  he said putting it in his pocket But when Cathy pretended to cry Hareton could not bear to make her sad and he threw the letter down on the table She eagerly read every word and asked me several questions about the people at the Grange</p>
<p>Mrs Dean will want an answer to her letter  I reminded her</p>
<p>You must tell her that I have no paper or pens to write with I haven&#x27;t even any books &#x27;she answered sadly</p>
<p>No books  I cried  How can you manage without them in this lonely place</p>
<p>I always used to read so much that Mr Heathcliff decided to take away my only pleasure and destroy my books I&#x27;ve looked all over the house for them Joseph only reads the Bible but some of my books are in Hareton&#x27;s room Why did you take them Hareton Just because you enjoy stealing They can&#x27;t be any use to you</p>
<p>I think Mr Hareton wants to learn  I said hoping to prevent a quarrel between them  No doubt he took them away to study them</p>
<p>Yes &#x27;replied Cathy laughing  I hear him trying to read to himself sometimes and it&#x27;s extremely funny He makes some terrible mistakes</p>
<p>After a moment&#x27;s shocked silence Hareton left the room He returned almost immediately with his arms full of books and threw them angrily down at Cathy&#x27;s feet</p>
<p>Take them  he shouted  I never want to see them again</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t have them now &#x27;she said  I&#x27;ll hate them because they&#x27;ll make me think of you</p>
<p>Hareton picked up the books and threw them on the fire then walked quickly out of the house</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff came in as Hareton went out He had a restless anxious expression on his face</p>
<p>Mr Heathcliff  I said  I must tell you I&#x27;m leaving for London next week for six months and I shan&#x27;t want to rent the Grange any more after October</p>
<p>So Mr Lockwood you&#x27;ve got tired of the moors already have you Well have your lunch with Hareton and me anyway Cathy take your lunch in the kitchen with Joseph and Zillah</p>
<p>I did not enjoy lunch with my two silent companions and left the Heights straight afterwards</p>
<p>What a pity  I thought  that Cathy Heathcliff and I didn&#x27;t fall in love as Mrs Dean would have liked Then I could have taken her away from this miserable place for ever</p>
<p>Several months later in September I was travelling to visit friends in Yorkshire I found myself near Thrushcross Grange and decided to spend a night there After all I was still paying rent for it When I arrived I was surprised to find a different housekeeper who told me Mrs Dean had become housekeeper at the Heights I wanted to have a walk after travelling all day so I left orders for the woman to cook my supper and prepare bedroom for me and I walked the four miles to Wuthering Heights</p>
<p>As I came close to the old house I noticed that there were flowers in the garden and the doors and windows stood open I could see two people inside and I stopped for a moment curious to hear a little of their conversation</p>
<p>Read it again stupid &#x27;said a voice as sweet as a silver bell  Read it correctly this time or I&#x27;ll pull your hair</p>
<p>You must kiss me if I get it right  answered a deep voice The man was sitting at a table reading from a book His handsome face shone with pleasure and his eyes often left the book to look at the small white hand that lay on his shoulder The girl stood behind him bending over to help him Her face it was fortunate he could not see her face or he would never have been able to concentrate on his studies I could see it and I was bitterly sorry that I had thrown away my chance of seeing that beauty every day of my life</p>
<p>I did not want to disturb their happiness so I went round to the back door where I discovered my old friend Ellen Dean</p>
<p>Oh Mr Lockwood welcome back &#x27;she cried  Are you staying at the Grange again</p>
<p>Yes Mrs Dean just for one night But tell me why are you housekeeper here now and not at the Grange</p>
<p>Zillah left you see and Mr Heathcliff wanted me here</p>
<p>I have a little business with him about the rent</p>
<p>Oh Mr Heathcliff is dead sir He died three months ago I manage all Mrs Heathcliff&#x27;s business for her She hasn&#x27;t learnt to do it herself yet you see</p>
<p>Heathcliff is dead  I repeated surprised  Well Tell me how it happened Mrs Dean</p>
<p>Sit down sir and drink some beer I&#x27;ll gladly tell you His life ended very strangely</p>
<p>18 Heathcliff&#x27;s end</p>
<p>1801 2 I was delighted to come back to the Heights and hoped I could make Cathy&#x27;s life more comfortable But she was restless and complained of loneliness At first she continued to annoy Hareton by laughing at him but after a while she decided she really wanted him as a friend She apologized for being rude to him and offered to teach him ev erything she knew From that moment on the two cousins have always been together studying Hareton has a lot to learn and Cathy is not the most patient of teachers But what they have in common is their love for each other You see Mr Lockwood it was easy enough to win Cathy&#x27;s heart But now I&#x27;m glad you didn&#x27;t try I&#x27;ll be the happiest woman in England when those two marry</p>
<p>Heathcliff noticed little of what was happening around him and would never have been aware of the cousins feelings if it hadn&#x27;t been for Joseph In the middle of our lunch one day the old man rushed into the room shaking with anger</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll have to leave I wanted to die here where I&#x27;ve been a servant for sixty years But now she&#x27;s taken my garden from me She&#x27;s stolen the boy&#x27;s soul master I can&#x27;t bear it</p>
<p>Is the fool drunk  asked Heathcliff  Can you explain this Hareton</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve pulled up two or three of his fruit-trees  confessed Hareton  but I&#x27;ll put them back again</p>
<p>It was my fault  added Cathy bravely  I asked him to do it We wanted to plant some flowers there</p>
<p>Who the devil gave you permission  growled Heathcliff</p>
<p>You should let me have a bit of garden as you&#x27;ve taken all my land &#x27;replied Cathy sharply  And you&#x27;ve taken Hareton&#x27;s land too He and I are friends now I&#x27;ll tell him about you</p>
<p>The master stood up staring at her fiercely</p>
<p>Out of the room wicked girl  he shouted  I&#x27;ll kill you if I get near you</p>
<p>If you hit me Hareton will hit you He won&#x27;t obey you any more and soon he&#x27;ll hate you as much as I do</p>
<p>You d better leave Cathy  whispered Hareton urgently  I won&#x27;t quarrel with Mr Heathcliff</p>
<p>But it was too late I was sure Heathcliff was going to hit her He took hold of her one strong hand in her hair and the other raised over her head But when he looked into her face his anger suddenly disappeared and he let his arm fall to his side He sat heavily down in his chair and put his hand over his eyes for a moment We all stared at him</p>
<p>You must learn not to make me angry  he said trying to be calm  Go away all of you Leave me alone  A little later he went out saying he would return in the evening</p>
<p>As darkness fell Cathy and Hareton were busy at their studies in the kitchen I was sitting with them happy to see them helping each other so well I feel they&#x27;re almost my children Mr Lockwood and I&#x27;m very proud of them As the master entered the house he had a full view of us three They lifted their eyes to meet his Perhaps you haven&#x27;t noticed it but their eyes are very similar and they are exactly like those of Catherine Earnshaw Mr Heathcliff stopped and stared then looked away At a sign from me Cathy and Hareton went quietly out into the garden leaving me alone with Mr Heathcliff</p>
<p>It&#x27;s silly isn&#x27;t it Ellen  he muttered  that I have worked all my life to destroy these two families the Earn shaws and the Lintons I&#x27;ve got their money and their land Now I can take my final revenge on the last Earnshaw and the last Linton I no longer want to There&#x27;s a strange change coming in my life I&#x27;m in its shadow I&#x27;m so little interested in daily events that I even forget to eat and drink I don&#x27;t want to see those two that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t care if they spend time together She only makes me angry And he looks so like Catherine But everything reminds me of Catherine In every cloud in every tree I see her face The whole world reminds me that she was here once and I have lost her</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t feel ill sir do you Are you afraid of death</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not ill Ellen and I&#x27;m not afraid to die But I can&#x27;t continue like this I have to remind myself to breathe almost to remind my heart to beat I have a single wish for some thing my whole body and heart and brain have wanted for so long Oh God It&#x27;s a long fight I wish it were finished</p>
<p>For some days after that Mr Heathcliff avoided meeting us at meals He ate less and less Late one night I heard him leave the house He did not return until the morning When he came in I noticed a change in his expression There was a strange wild happiness in his face although he was pale and trembling</p>
<p>Will you have some breakfast sir  I asked</p>
<p>No I&#x27;m not hungry  he answered</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think you should stay outside at night sir You&#x27;ll catch a bad cold or a fever</p>
<p>Leave me alone Ellen  he replied</p>
<p>I began to worry about him He was strong and healthy but a man must eat in order to live For the next three days he ate nothing At every meal the food lay untouched on the plate in front of him He did not look at the food or at us He seemed to be looking at something quite close to him some thing we could not see His fierce black eyes followed it with such eager interest that he sometimes stopped breathing for as much as half a minute</p>
<p>He did not sleep either For three days he had spent the night in Catherine Earnshaw&#x27;s old bedroom and I could hear him walking up and down and talking calling crying all night</p>
<p>One morning I managed to speak to him and make him listen to me  Mr Heathcliff you must have some food and sleep Look at yourself in the mirror You look ill and tired</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not my fault that I can&#x27;t eat or rest You wouldn&#x27;t tell a drowning man to rest when he can see the shore I&#x27;m close to what I&#x27;ve wanted for eighteen years very close But my soul&#x27;s happiness is killing my body</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a strange kind of happiness master Take my advice and pray to God to forgive you for what you&#x27;ve done wrong in the past if you think you&#x27;re going to die</p>
<p>Thank you Ellen you&#x27;ve reminded me of something It&#x27;s the way I want to be buried My coffin will be carried to the churchyard in the evening You and Hareton will be present nobody else And make sure my orders about the two coffins are obeyed I want no ceremony or words from the Bible I don&#x27;t believe in any of that</p>
<p>He spent the next night and the next day in Catherine&#x27;s room muttering and sobbing all the time I sent for Dr Kenneth but the door was locked so the doctor could not see him The following night was very wet and in the morning as I walked in the garden I noticed that the bedroom window was wide open</p>
<p>He must be very wet if he&#x27;s in bed  I thought  the bed is so close to the window I&#x27;ll go and look  I found another key which fitted the lock and opened the door Mr Heathcliff was there in bed lying on his back His eyes were staring at me so eagerly and fiercely and he seemed to be smiling His face and clothes were wet from the rain and he did not move I realized he was dead</p>
<p>I closed the window I combed his long black hair from his forehead I tried to close his eyes but they would not shut Suddenly frightened I called for Joseph The old servant came at once but refused to touch the body</p>
<p>Ah the devil&#x27;s taken his soul I warned him that would happen  he cried  You see how wicked he is smiling at death But thank God Hareton Earnshaw will have the house and land now that he should have inherited from his father  And he went down on his knees to pray</p>
<p>Hareton was in fact the only one who was sad at Heathcliff&#x27;s death He and I were present at the burial Heathcliff was buried next to Catherine&#x27;s grave as he had wished As we were not sure of his age or anything else about him there is only one word on his gravestone Heathcliff The villagers are very frightened of his ghost They say he often haunts the churchyard and the moors</p>
<p>Hareton and Cathy will be married on New Year&#x27;s Day and they&#x27;ll move to the Grange I&#x27;ll be their housekeeper Joseph will take care of Wuthering Heights but most of the rooms here won&#x27;t be used again</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll pass the churchyard Mr Lockwood on your way back to the Grange and you&#x27;ll see the three gravestones close to the moor Catherine&#x27;s the middle one is old now and half buried in plants which have grown over it On one side is Edgar Linton&#x27;s and on the other is Heathcliff&#x27;s new one If you stay there a moment and watch the insects flying in the warm summer air and listen to the soft wind breathing through the grass you&#x27;ll understand how quietly they rest the sleepers in that quiet earth</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div
